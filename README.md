Ecosystem risk assessments with R


ecorisk is a R package designed to perform and analyse (ecosystem) risk assessments. 
It is aimed at data or information limited risk assessments, by providing two possible workflow pathways – one expert scoring based and one time series based approach. Both approaches can be combined and compared. Thus the package can be applied to a broader variety of ecosystems and indicators. For example the model based approach can be used for integrated indicators. 

The package will be published under this repository soon!
