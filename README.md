Ecosystem risk assessments with R

ecorisk is a R package designed to perform and analyse (ecosystem) risk
assessments. It is aimed at data or information limited risk
assessments, by providing two possible workflow pathways â€“ one expert
scoring based and one time series based approach. Both approaches can be
combined and compared. Thus the package can be applied to a broader
variety of ecosystems and indicators. The model based approach is also
especially useful for integrated indicators.

The package will be published under this repository soon!
