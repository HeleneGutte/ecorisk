## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Rewritten the DESCRIPTION to avoid the word ecorisk 
  in the description.

* Simplified the examples in model_exposure() and 
  plot_heatmap() to decrease run times.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

The note 
checking for future file timestamps ... NOTE
  unable to verify current time 
could not be eliminated.
