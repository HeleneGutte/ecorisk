abstract = {Baltic grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) alternate between land and ice breeding, depending on ice conditions. We show that the fitness of grey seal females in terms of pup mortality and quality is reduced when breeding on land as compared with ice. The mean preweaning mortality rate on land was 21.1{\%} (range 0{\%} to 31.6{\%}), and correlated with birth density (range 0.5-5.2 pups 100 m-2). The mean mortality rate on ice was 1.5{\%}, where the highest density was 0.2 pups 100 m-2 in particularly dense breeding groups. Mean weights of pups born on ice were significantly greater (48.3 ± 8.1 kg) at the onset of moult as compared with pups born on land (37.4 ± 7.8 kg). Because indices of life-time net reproductive rate (pup survival) and pup quality (weaning weight and health) were more auspicious on ice as compared with land, diminishing ice fields will lower the fitness of Baltic grey seal females and substantially increase the risk for quasi-extinction. {\textcopyright} Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2008.},

abstract = {The grey seal was a common species along mainland Europe during the Stone Age (8,000-5,500 BC). Along the North Sea coast populations started to decline substantially during the 11th century as a result of excessive hunting. The last breeding populations disappeared in the 16th century in the Wadden Sea, and before 1900 in the Kattegat-Skagerrak and the Southwestern Baltic as a result of an extermination campaign. No regular pupping occurred along mainland Europe until the end of the 1970s, when a breeding colony was established near Amrum in the German Wadden Sea. Somewhat later, additional breeding sites were discovered near Terschelling in the Dutch Wadden Sea (1980), at Helgoland, and off Brittany in France. Tracking of movements indicate these seal groups to be linked to the larger populations in the UK. Numbers of grey seals in the recolonised areas have increased over the years, but in the Kattegat-Skagerrak stable numbersof about 25 individuals have been observed since the 1970s, whereas more than 100 grey seals are found in the Southwestern Baltic. In the southeastern North Sea, 120 grey seals occur during moult at Helgoland, 120 in the German and over 1,130 in the Dutch parts of the Wadden Sea in 2004. Along the southern Dutch and Belgian coasts small groups are regularly observed, but no colonies have yet been established. In the colonies off Brittany in France about 105 grey seals have been counted. Successful pupping has only been recorded 3 times in the Kattegat-Skagerrak over the past 30 years, and 2-4 pups are born annually in France and the Southwestern Baltic. The relative strongholds for breeding along the European continent are the Dutch Wadden Sea, where in 2003/2004 at least 150 pups were recorded, Amrum in the German Wadden Sea (23 pups) and Helgoland (8 pups). Consequently, total numbers of counted grey seals from the Southwestern Baltic to France amounted to at least 1,600 in 2004, while about 190 pups were born in the area.},

abstract = {Large-scale climatic conditions prevailing over the central Baltic Sea resulted in declining salinity and oxygen concentrations in spawning areas of the eastern Baltic cod stock. These changes in hydrography reduced the reproductive success and, combined with high fishing pressure, caused a decline of the stock to the lowest level on record in the early 1990s. The present study aims at disentangling the interactions between reproductive effort and hydrographic forcing leading to variable recruitment. Based on identified key processes, stock dynamics is explained using updated environmental and life stage-specific abundance and production time-series. Declining salinities and oxygen concentrations caused high egg mortalities and indirectly increased egg predation by clupeid fish. Low recruitment, despite enhanced hydrographic conditions for egg survival in the mid-1990s, was due to food limitation for larvae, caused by the decline in the abundance of the copepod Pseudocalanus sp. The case of the eastern Baltic cod stock exemplifies the multitude effects climatic variability may have on a fish stock and underscores the importance of knowledge of these processes for understanding stock dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Individual fish trajectories were obtained by target tracking methods, and average swimming velocities as a function of depth and time before and after passage of the vessel was calculated. A measure for the change in behaviour was applied, showing a significant response during and after propeller passage. The change in horizontal displacement speed is significant at all depths, while the change in vertical displacement velocity is significant at all but one layer of depth. The horizontal reaction seems to occur a bit later than the diving reaction. After the main response, a slightly higher mean horizontal displacement speed was observed for the deepest layers. This indicates a change in the fish state after being exposed to the vessel/gear. {\textcopyright} 2003 {\'{E}}ditions scientifiques et m{\'{e}}dicales Elsevier SAS and Ifremer/IRD/Inra/Cemagref.

abstract = {Organic P and organic C concentrations were measured in several well-characterized Phanerozoic marine shale sequences with the primary focus being the Camp Run Member of the Devonian-Mississippian New Albany Shale. Sequences were selected with close spatial association of bioturbated and laminated sediments which reflect deposition from oxic and anoxic waters, respectively. Average organic C/P mole ratios calculated from the data are 150 for bioturbated shales and 3900 for the laminated shales of the New Albany. Differences in the extent and mechanisms of early diagenesis related to the oxygenation of waters at the sediment-water interface can account for the C/P ratios of buried organic matter. Low C/P ratios of bioturbated sediments are attributed to 1. (1) the increased ability of bacteria to store P in well-oxygenated environments which leads to the production of low C/P ratio bacterial biomass and 2. (2) the extensive oxidation of sedimentary organic matter resulting in the formation of residual organic phases with low C/P ratios. High organic C/P ratios of laminated sediments are explained by a combination of 1. (1) the limited ability of bacteria to store P under anoxic conditions, 2. (2) extensive P regeneration from sedimentary organic matter, 3. (3) enhanced C preservation relative to the bioturbated shales. It is also shown that relative to organic C, laminated shales are not as effective a P sink as are bioturbated shales. This provides a mechanism in anoxic environments for burying large quantities of organic matter without simultaneously sequestering the P needed to sustain further productivity. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {The Baltic Sea is one of the world's marine areas well-covered by both long-term observations and oceanographic studies. It is also a large coastal area in which eutrophication had already been recognized half a century ago. While the mechanisms of eutrophication are largely understood, several features are less recognized and sometimes neglected, including: (a) natural and anthropogenic North-South and East-West nutrient gradients within the drainage basin and marine ecosystems; (b) the compensatory potential of the interconnectivity between the Baltic Sea basins; (c) long nutrient residence times and high buffer capacity of the system, resulting in slow responses to nutrient load reductions. Particularly important is the interaction of (d) naturally occurring saltwater inflows sporadically ventilating deep water layers and (e) a partly man-made intensification of biological oxygen consumption. Resulting redox alterations of biogeochemical nitrogen and phosphorus cycles are locked in a "vicious circle" that promotes cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation, thereby hindering nitrogen load reduction and sustaining an elevated trophic state. This tight coupling of natural environmental variation and human impacts complicates both scientific studies and management recommendations. Our primary objective is to describe all these features and mechanisms with the best available data on nutrient loads, and unique estimates of the basin-wide nutrient pools. These data are presented as both long-term time series and empirical nutrient budgets. The analysis is supplemented by results of biogeochemical modeling. A second, more practical objective is to make these time series available to the community.},

abstract = {A 30-yr climate data record (CDR) of sea surface temperature (SST) has been produced with daily gap-free analysis fields for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea region from 1982 to 2012 by combining the Pathfinder AVHRR satellite data record with the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) Reprocessing for Climate (ARC) dataset and with in situ observations. A dynamical bias correction scheme adjusts the Pathfinder observations toward the ARC and in situ observations. Largest Pathfinder-ARC differences are found in the summer months, when the Pathfinder observations are up to 0.4°C colder than the ARC observations on average. Validation against independent in situ observations shows a very stable performance of the data record, with a mean difference of -0.06°C compared to moored buoys and a 0.46°C standard deviation of the differences. The mean annual biases of the SST CDR are small for all years, with a negligible temporal trend when compared against drifting and moored buoys. Analysis of the SST CDR reveals that the monthly anomalies for the North Sea, the Danish straits, and the central Baltic Sea regions show a high degree of correlation for interannual and decadal time scales, whereas the monthly variability differs from one region to another. The linear trends of the 1982-2012 SST anomaly time series range from 0.037°C yr-1 for the North Sea to 0.041°C yr-1 for the Baltic Sea.},

abstract = {The Baltic Sea is highly impacted by global warming and other anthropogenic changes and is one of the fastest-warming marginal seas in the world. To detect trends in water temperature and to attribute them to atmospheric parameters, the results of two different ocean circulation models driven by reconstructed atmospheric forcing fields for the period 1850–2008 were analyzed. The model simulations were analyzed at temporal and spatial scales from seasonal to centennial and from intrabasin to basin, respectively. The strongest 150-year trends were found in the annual mean bottom temperature of the Bornholm Deep (0.15 K/decade) and in summer mean sea surface temperature (SST) in Bothnian Bay (0.09–0.12 K/decade). A comparison of the time periods 1856–2005 and 1978–2007 revealed that the SST trends strengthened tenfold. An attribution analysis showed that most of the SST variability could be explained by the surface air temperature (i.e., sensible heat flux) and the latent heat flux. Wind parallel to the coast and cloudiness additionally explained SST variability in the coastal zone affected by the variations in upwelling and in offshore areas affected by the variations in solar radiation, respectively. In contrast, the high variability in stratification caused by freshwater and saltwater inflows does not impact the long-term variability in the SST averaged over the Baltic Sea. The strongest SST trends since the 1980s can be explained by the superposition of global warming and a shift from the cold to the warm phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.},

abstract = {Sprat, Sprattus sprattus L., is a small schooling clupeid forming large stocks in several ecosystems. Despite its high trophodynamic impact, little is known about its energy consumption rates. As a central component of a bioenergetic budget, metabolic rates of sprat from 3.11 to 9.71 g wet weight (WW) were measured at nine different temperatures (T) ranging from 9 to 21°C using a computer-controlled intermittent-flow respirometer. Routine metabolism (RR) was related to T (°C) and WW (g) by RR = 0.074 WW1.077 e0.080 T. Standard metabolic rates (RS) as calculated from the 10{\%} percentiles of the repeated measurements were on average 12{\%} lower and still influenced by continuous swimming activity: RS = 0.069 WW1.073 e0.078 T. We interpret the deviation of the scaling exponent b from typically found exponents of b {\~{}} 0.8 as a consequence of permanently elevated activity level. The high permanent swimming activities also indicated that the concept of standard metabolism may not be meaningful in schooling planktivorous fish. These results suggest that generally in bioenergetic models for clupeid schooling fish the activity multipliers should be chosen very conservatively. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Stock development of cod and sprat, two major fish species in the Baltic Sea, is linked by trophic interactions. Depending on recruitment success the Baltic may be pushed towards either a cod- or a clupeid dominated system. Both cod and sprat spawn in the Baltic deep basins at strongly varying hydrographical conditions with survival during the egg and early larval stages regarded as a major bottleneck. Due to differences in egg specific gravity, cod and sprat eggs occur at different depths and are thus subject to different hydrographical conditions. For sprat, weak year-classes have been associated with low water temperatures during peak spawning. For cod the shift in peak spawning from spring to summer during the 1990s has been discussed as a reason for the poor recruitment at present as delayed spawning may involve egg development at too high temperatures. In the present study cod and sprat eggs and yolk sac larvae were incubated at different temperatures, 1-11°C for cod and 1-13°C for sprat. No difference in viable hatch occurred in the range 3-9°C for cod and in the range 5-13°C for sprat. Larval viability decreased at 11°C for cod and at ≤5°C for sprat. Comparing the results with vertical egg distribution and temperature profiles from field studies suggested no major influence of temperature on cod reproduction, but a considerable effect on sprat. The results imply that different environmental conditions; frequency of major saline water inflows into the Baltic Sea for cod, and water temperature in the upper layers, e.g. following severe/mild winters, for sprat, involve different opportunities for egg and larval survival and may thus cause a displacement in the balance between cod and sprat.},

abstract = {We analysed spatial and temporal patterns of condition factor (CF) of sprat (Sprattus sprattus) between 1986 and 2000 in different areas of the Baltic proper. Results showed a moderate increase in CF between 1986 and 1989. Afterwards, an abrupt decrease in CF, between 22{\%} and 29{\%}, occurred in all the areas of the Baltic proper. However, from 1998 and onwards, CF increased compared to the previous years. Weight-at-age and CF of Baltic herring showed a similar pattern in the same period. Several factors affecting variability of sprat CF were evaluated. Data showed that sprat CF was density-dependent and possibly related to the pelagic fish abundance and individual food intake. Temperature did not influence sprat CF while salinity seemed to affect variability of sprat CF in the northern Baltic proper. Changes in salinity levels may shape pelagic fish growth rates both indirectly changing the zooplankton community structure and abundance and/or directly via fish physiology and metabolisms. {\textcopyright} 2002 Ifremer/CNRS/Inra/IRD/Cemagref/{\'{E}}ditions scientifiques et m{\'{e}}dicales Elsevier SAS.

Interannual dynamics (1959-1999) of calanoid copepods Pseudocalanus elongatus, Temora longicornis and Acartia spp. in the Central Baltic Sea are described for dif­ ferent life-stages. Using principal component (PCA) and correlation analysis the asso­ ciation of the stage-specific abundance to salinity and temperature was investigated. P. elongatus dynamics were related to high salinities in spring favouring maturation and reproduction. Additionally, low temperatures appear to be favourable for repro­ duction, whereas intermediate copepodite stages were positively correlated to tem­ perature. T. longicornis and Acartia spp. life-stages were consistently associated with higher temperatures in spring. Furthermore, there are indications that T. longicornis maturation and reproductive success in summer is affected by salinity levels similarly to P. elongatus.},

abstract = {Identifying the processes that drive changes in the abundance and distribution of natural populations is a central theme in ecology and evolution. Many species of marine mammals have experienced dramatic changes in abundance and distribution due to climatic fluctuations and anthropogenic impacts. However, thanks to conservation efforts, some of these species have shown remarkable population recovery and are now recolonizing their former ranges. Here, we use zooarchaeological, demographic and genetic data to examine processes of colonization, local extinction and recolonization of the two northern European grey seal subspecies inhabiting the Baltic Sea and North Sea. The zooarchaeological and genetic data suggest that the two subspecies diverged shortly after the formation of the Baltic Sea approximately 4200 years bp, probably through a gradual shift to different breeding habitats and phenologies. By comparing genetic data from 19th century pre-extinction material with that from seals currently recolonizing their past range, we observed a marked spatiotemporal shift in subspecies boundaries, with increasing encroachment of North Sea seals on areas previously occupied by the Baltic Sea subspecies. Further, both demographic and genetic data indicate that the two subspecies have begun to overlap geographically and are hybridizing in a narrow contact zone. Our findings provide new insights into the processes of colonization, extinction and recolonization and have important implications for the management of grey seals across northern Europe.},

abstract = {The growing number of grey seals in the Baltic Sea has led to a dramatic increase in interactions between seals and fisheries. The conflict has become such a problem that hunting was introduced in Finland in 1998 and the Swedish Environment Protection Agency recommended a cull of grey seals starting in 2001. Culling has been implemented despite the lack of data on population structure. Low levels of migration between regions would mean that intensive culling in specific geographic areas would have disproportionate effects on local population structure and genetic diversity. We used eight microsatellite loci and a 489 bp section of the mtDNA control region to examine the genetic variability and differentiation between three breeding sites in the Baltic Sea and two in the UK. We found high levels of genetic variability in all sampled Baltic groups for both the microsatellites and the control region. There were highly significant differences in microsatellite allele frequencies between all three Baltic breeding sites and between the Baltic sites and the UK sites. However, there were no significant differences in mtDNA control region haplotypes between the Baltic sites. This genetic substructure of the Baltic grey seal populations should be taken into consideration when managing the seal population to prevent the hunting regime from having an adverse effect on genetic diversity by setting hunting quotas separately for the different subpopulations. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Pseudocalanus elongatus is a key species in the pelagic zone of the deep basins of the Central Baltic Sea. The copepod serves as a major food organism for larval as well as for adult, pelagic planktivorous fish. Large interannual fluctuations in the standing stock of P. elongatus have been attributed to significant changes in the hydrographic environment over the last two decades. In particular, the decreasing salinity in the Baltic deep basins, a result of a change in atmospheric forcing leading to an increase in rainfall since the 1980s and of a lack of pulses of saline water intrusions from the North Sea, was found to affect reproduction and maturation of the copepod. In parallel, dramatic changes in the weight-at-age of herring, one of the most important commercial fishes of the Baltic Sea, have been observed since the late 1980s. Using time-series on herring stomach contents, as well as length and weight, we provide evidence for a chain of events relating variability in climate, salinity and P. elongatus abundance to changes in diet and condition of herring in the Central Baltic Sea.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the intensity of spatial overlap between aquatic top predators and fisheries is required to efficiently alleviate the negative effects of marine mammal-fishery interactions. We used satellite telemetry to study the movements and habitat use of Baltic grey seals Halichoerus grypus, with special focus on the degree of site fidelity to foraging and haul-out areas and spatiotemporal overlap with coastal fisheries. Most of the tracked seals (14/16 individuals) were 'residents', which remained within 120 ± 62 km (mean ± SD) of their capture sites during the open-water season, whereas 2 'transient' seals occupied much larger areas, over 400 km from their capture sites. Residents used on average 4.3 ± 2.5 haul-out sites, indicating high haul-out site fidelity during the open-water season. Residents had active core areas (58 ± 35 km2, 50{\%} local nearest-neighbour convex hull [LoCoH], excluding haul-out locations) near river estuaries or at other shallow water areas, indicating foraging-site fidelity to these foraging grounds. They overlapped both spatially and temporally with trap-net fishing. The high site fidelity of grey seals indicates that foraging and haul-out areas should be taken into account in population management. Selective removal of seals over - lapping with fishery could be a locally focused method to mitigate seal-fishery interactions. However, removal of individuals in foraging areas may also compromise the conservation needs of the population by targeting the same animals that are hauling out in seal sanctuaries. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2014.},

abstract = {Wildlife population dynamics are shaped by multiple natural and anthropogenic factors, including predation, competition, stressful life history events, and external environmental stressors such as diseases and pollution. Marine mammals such as gray seals rely on extensive blubber layers for insulation and energy storage, making this tissue critical for survival and reproduction. This lipid rich blubber layer also accumulates hazardous fat soluble pollutants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), that can directly impact adipose function or be mobilized during periods of negative energy balance or transferred to offspring to exert further impacts on target tissues or vulnerable life stages. To predict how marine mammals will respond to ecological and anthropogenic stressors, it is necessary to use process-based modelling approaches that integrate environmental inputs, full species life history, and stressor impacts with individual dynamics of energy intake, storage, and utilization. The purpose of this study was to develop a full lifecycle dynamic energy budget and individual based model (DEB-IBM) that captured Baltic gray seal physiology and life history, and showcase potential applications of the model to predict population responses to select stressors known to threaten gray seals and other marine mammals around the world. We explore variations of three ecologically important stressors using phenomenological simulations: food limitation, endocrine disrupting chemicals that reduce fertility, and infectious disease. Using our calibrated DEB-IBM for Baltic gray seals, we found that continuous incremental food limitation can be more detrimental to population size than short random events of starvation, and further, that the effect of endocrine disruptors on population growth and structure is delayed due to bioaccumulation, and that communicable diseases significantly decrease population growth even when spillover events are relatively less frequent. One important finding is the delayed effect on population growth rate from some stressors, several years after the exposure period, resulting from a decline in somatic growth, increased age at maturation and decreased fecundity. Such delayed responses are ignored in current models of population viability and can be important in the correct assessment of population extinction risks. The model presented here provides a test bed on which effects of new hazardous substances and different scenarios of future environmental change affecting food availability and/or seal energetic demands can be investigated. Thus, the framework provides a tool for better understanding how diverse environmental stressors affect marine mammal populations and can be used to guide scientifically based management.},

abstract = {Dietary studies are important in understanding the ecological role of marine mammals and in formulating appropriate management plans in terms of their interactions with fisheries. The validity of such studies has, however, often been compromised by unrepresentative sampling procedures, resulting in false weight being given to external factors seeming to influence diet composition. The bias caused by non-random sampling was examined, using canonical correspondence analysis to assess how the prey species composition in digestive tract samples of Baltic grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) was related to spatial, temporal, and demographic factors and to whether the samples were collected in association with fishing gear or not ("sampling condition"). Geographic region explained the largest fraction of the observed variation, followed by sampling condition, age group, and year. Season and gender were not statistically significant. Segregation of the two age categories "pups" and "juveniles-adults", and the two geographic categories "Baltic proper" and "Gulf of Bothnia" are proposed to estimate the diet and fish consumption of the Baltic grey seal population as a whole. Atlantic herring was the most commonly recovered prey item in all areas and age groups, followed by European sprat in the south, and common whitefish in the north. Pups had eaten relatively more small non-commercial species than older seals. {\textcopyright} 2010 United States Government, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, Southwest Fisheries Science Center.},

abstract = {Populations of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus), sprats (Sprattus sprattus) and cod (Gadus morhua) in the Baltic Sea are relatively stationary. The present work, applying classical and molecular helminthological techniques, documents that seals and cod also share a common parasite, the anisakid nematode Contracaecum osculatum, which uses seals as the final host and fish as transport hosts. Sequencing mitochondrial genes (COX1 and COX2) in adult worms from seals and third-stage larvae from livers of Baltic fish (sprats and cod), showed that all gene variants occur in both seals and fish. Other anisakid nematodes Pseudoterranova decipiens and Anisakis simplex are also found in both seals and cod in the Baltic Sea, but at much lower rates. The Baltic grey seal population was left at a critically low level (comprising a few hundred individuals) during the latter part of the 20th century, but since the year 2000 a marked increase in the population has been observed, reaching more than 40,000 individuals at present. Ecological consequences of the increased seal abundance may result from increased predation on fish stocks, but recent evidence also points to the influence of elevated parasitism on fish performance. Contracaecum osculatum larvae preferentially infect the liver of Baltic cod, considered a vital organ of the host. Whereas low prevalences and intensities in cod were reported during the 1980s and 1990s, the present study documents 100{\%} prevalence and a mean intensity of above 80 worms per fish. Recent studies have also indicated the zoonotic potential of C. osculatum larvae in fish, following the consumption of raw or under-cooked fish. Therefore the present work discusses the impact of parasitism on the cod stock and the increasing risk for consumer health, and lists possible solutions for control.},

abstract = {Baltic seals are recovering after a population decline. The increasing seal stocks cause notable damage to fisheries in the Baltic Sea, with an unknown number of seals drowning in fishing gear every year. Thus, sustainable seal management requires updated knowledge of the by-catch of seals - the number of specimens that die in fishing gear. We analyse the by-catch of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in Finland, Sweden, and Estonia in 2012. We collect data with interviews (35 in Finland, 54 in Sweden, and 72 in Estonia) and analyse them with a hierarchical Bayesian model. The model accounts for variability in seal abundance, seal mortality and fishing effort in different sub-areas of the Baltic Sea and allows us to predict the by-catch in areas where interview data was not available. We provide a detailed description of the survey design and interview methods, and discuss different factors affecting fishermen's motivation to report by-catch and how this may affect the results. Our analysis shows that the total yearly by-catch by trap and gill nets in Finland, Sweden and Estonia is, with 90{\%} probability, more than 1240 but less than 2860; and the posterior median and mean of the total by-catch are 1550 and 1880 seals, respectively. Trap nets make about 88{\%} of the total by-catch. However, results also indicate that in one of the sub-areas of this study, fishermen may have underreported their by-catch. Taking the possible underreporting into account the posterior mean of the total by-catch is between 2180 and 2380. The bycatch in our study area is likely to represent at least 90{\%} of the total yearly grey seal by-catch in the Baltic Sea.},

abstract = {The Central Baltic Sea is the largest brackish waterbody in the world ocean, containing a highly productive but low-diversity ecosystem. Climate-induced changes in hydrography recently caused an ecosystem regime shift with changes at all trophic levels. The most pronounced changes in the ecosystem occurred at the zooplankton and fish trophic levels. In the zooplankton, dominance changed between the copepods Pseudocalanus acuspes and Acartia spp., a result of reduced salinities and increased temperatures. The change in hydrography also affected the reproductive success of the major fish species, resulting in a change in dominance from the piscivorous cod (Gadus morhua) to the planktivorous sprat (Sprattus sprattus). First, we investigate statistically the occurrence of regime shifts in time-series of key hydrographic variables and the biomass time-series of key species. Second, we demonstrate a three-level trophic cascade involving zooplankton. Finally, we model the ecosystem effects of the abiotic and biotic changes on copepod biomass and recruitment of fish stocks. Our results demonstrate the linkage between climate-induced zooplankton and fish regime changes, and how overfishing amplified the climate-induced changes at both trophic levels. Hence, our study demonstrates (i) the multiple pathways along which climatic and anthropogenic pressures can propagate through the foodweb; (ii) how both effects act synergistically to cause and stabilize regime changes; and (iii) the crucial role of zooplankton in mediating these ecosystem changes. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {The Baltic Sea comprises a heterogeneous oceanographic environment influencing the spatial and temporal potential for reproductive success of cod (Gadus morhua) and sprat (Sprattus sprattus) in the different spawning basins. Hence, to quantify stock and recruitment dynamics, it is necessary to resolve species-specific regional reproductive success in relation to size, structure, and distribution of the spawning stock. Furthermore, as species and fisheries interactions vary between areas, it is necessary to include these interactions on an area-specific basis. Therefore, area-disaggregated multispecies virtual population analyses (MSVPA) were performed for interacting species cod, herring (Clupea harengus), and sprat in the different subdivisions of the Central Baltic. The MSVPA runs revealed distinct spatial trends in population abundance, spawning biomass, recruitment, and predation-induced mortality. Results, when evaluated with respect to trends in population sizes from research surveys, were similar for the cod and sprat stocks but different for herring. Horizontal distributions from MSVPA runs and research surveys indicate that cod and sprat undergo migrations between basins during different life stages. This is an observation potentially influencing estimates for the different stock components but not affecting the overall stock sizes.},

abstract = {Marine ecosystems such as the Baltic Sea are currently under strong atmospheric and anthropogenic pressure. Besides natural and human-induced changes in climate, major anthropogenic drivers such as overfishing and anthropogenic eutrophication are significantly affecting ecosystem structure and function. Recently, studies demonstrated the existence of alternative stable states in various terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. These so-called ecosystem regime shifts have been explained mainly as a result of multiple causes, e.g. climatic regime shifts, overexploitation or a combination of both. The occurrence of ecosystem regime shifts has important management implications, as they can cause significant losses of ecological and economic resources. Because of hysteresis in ecosystem responses, restoring regimes considered as favourable may require drastic and expensive management actions. Also the Baltic Sea, the largest brackish water body in the world ocean, and its ecosystems are strongly affected by atmospheric and anthropogenic drivers. Here, we present results of an analysis of the state and development of the Central Baltic Sea ecosystem integrating hydroclimatic, nutrient, phyto- and zooplankton as well as fisheries data. Our analyses of 52 biotic and abiotic variables using multivariate statistics demonstrated a major reorganization of the ecosystem and identified two stable states between 1974 and 2005, separated by a transition period in 1988-1993. We show the change in Baltic ecosystem structure to have the characteristics of a discontinuous regime shift, initiated by climate-induced changes in the abiotic environment and stabilized by fisheries-induced feedback loops in the food web. Our results indicate the importance of maintaining the resilience of an ecosystem to atmospherically induced environmental change by reducing the anthropogenic impact. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing.},

abstract = {Recruitment patterns of Baltic Sea sprat (Sprattus sprattus) were correlated to time series of (i) month- and depth-specific temperature conditions and (ii) larval drift patterns inferred from long-term Lagrangian particle simulations. From the latter, we derived an index that likely reflected the variable degree of annual larval transport from the central, deep spawning basins to the shallow coastal areas of the Baltic Sea. The drift index was significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) correlated to sprat recruitment success and explained, together with sprat spawning stock biomass, 82{\%} of the overall variability between 1979 and 2003. Years of strong larval displacement towards southern and eastern Baltic coasts corresponded to relative recruitment failure, while years of retention within the deep basins were associated with relative recruitment success. The strongest correlation between temperature and recruitment occurred during August in surface waters, explaining 73{\%} of the overall variability. Together, the two approaches advocate that new year classes of Baltic sprat are predominantly composed of individuals born late in the season and are determined in strength mainly by processes acting during the late larval and early juvenile stages. However, prior to be included in recruitment predictions, the biological mechanisms underlying these strong correlations may need to be better resolved. {\textcopyright} 2006 NRC.},

abstract = {A unique dataset of stomach contents sampled between 1977 and 1999 in the central Baltic Sea was used to perform a comprehensive study of the feeding ecology of Central Baltic herring Clupea harengus and sprat Sprattus sprattus. Both fish species were mainly preying upon calanoid copepods with Pseudocalanus sp. dominating the diet of herring, whereas sprat generally preferred Temora longicornis. Sprat preyed upon older copepodite stages, indicating size-selective particulate feeding, whereas herring additionally fed on smaller copepodite stages, indicating occasional low food supply inducing filter-feeding. Additional food sources other than copepods were mysids in winter and autumn for medium to large herring, as well as cladocerans for sprat in spring and summer, determined by the seasonal occurrence of these plankton species. Seasonally the highest feeding activity of both fishes species occurred in spring and summer, the main reproductive periods of calanoid copepods. The most important food item for both predators in spring was Pseudocalanus sp. In summer sprat switched to T. longicornis and Acartia spp. Since the late 1970s, the total stomach fullness decreased and the fraction of empty stomachs increased. In parallel the amount of Pseudocalanus sp. in the diets of both fish species decreased. Further, a considerable dietary overlap between both species in spring indicated considerable competition for food resources, especially due to an enlarged sprat stock. The results of this study support the hypothesis that growth reductions observed in Baltic herring and sprat are due to combination of a change in food availability and an increase in density-dependent competition. {\textcopyright} 2004 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

abstract = {Temperature effects on Baltic sprat are many and include both direct and indirect effects. Increasing temperature is thought to increase the survival of all early life stages, resulting in increased recruitment success. We quantified the spatially resolved temperature trend for major spawning grounds and depth layers being most relevant for sprat eggs and larvae, using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model for 19792005. Results confirmed an underlying positive temperature trend. Next, we tested these time-series as new explanatory variables in an existing temperature-dependent recruitment function and applied these recruitment predictions in an age-structured ecologicaleconomic optimization model, maximizing for profit. Economic optimal solutions depended upon variability in temperature trajectories. Under climate-change scenarios, mean optimal fishing mortality and related yields and profits increased. The extent of the increase was limited by the general shape of the stockrecruitment model and the assumption of density-dependence. This highlights the need to formulate better environmentally sensitive stock recruitment models. Under the current knowledge of Baltic sprat recruitment, the tested climate-change scenarios would result in a change in management targets. However, to serve as a quantitative management advice tool, models will have to address the above-mentioned concerns. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

abstract = {A wide range of possible recruitment drivers were tested for key exploited fish species in the Baltic Sea Regional Advisory Council (RAC) area: Eastern Baltic Cod, Central Baltic Herring, Gulf of Riga Herring, and sprat. For each of the stocks, two hypotheses were tested: (i) recruitment is significantly related to spawning stock biomass, climatic forcing, and feeding conditions and (ii) by acknowledging these drivers, management decisions can be improved. Climate impact expressed by climatic indices or changes in water temperature was included in all the final models. Recruitment of the herring stock appeared to be influenced by different factors: the spawning stock biomass, winter Baltic Sea Index prior to spawning, and potentially the November-December sea surface temperature during the winter after spawning were important to Gulf of Riga Herring, while the final models for Central Baltic Herring included spawning stock biomass and August sea surface temperature. Recruitment of sprat appeared to be influenced by July-August temperature, but was independent of the spawning biomass when SSB. {\textgreater} 200,000 tons. Recruitment of Eastern Baltic Cod was significantly related to spawning stock biomass, the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index, and the reproductive volume in the Gotland Basin in May. All the models including extrinsic factors significantly improved prediction ability as compared to traditional models, which account for impacts of the spawning stock biomass alone. Based on the final models the minimum spawning stock biomass to derive the associated minimum recruitment under average environmental conditions was calculated for each stock. Using uncertainty analyses, the spawning stock biomass required to produce associated minimum recruitment was presented with different probabilities considering the influence of the extrinsic drivers. This tool allows for recruitment to be predicted with a required probability, that is, higher than the average 50{\%} estimated from the models. Further, this approach considers unfavorable environmental conditions which mean that a higher spawning stock biomass is needed to maintain recruitment at a required level. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The recruitment processes of Baltic cod and sprat were analysed and critical periods were identified by addressing the major impact factors on individual early life history stages separately and relating observed abundance data between successive stages. For cod, recruitment appeared to be dependent on egg survival, with low oxygen concentration in dwelling depths and predation by clupeids as the major causes for egg mortality. Surviving egg production and larval abundance were weakly correlated, whereas larval abundance was significantly related to year class strength. This indicated that the period between the late egg and the early larval stage is critical for cod recruitment. A potential variable identified to affect this life stage was prey availability for larvae. For sprat, early and late egg stage production as well as late egg stage production and larval abundance were significantly related. However, year class strength was largely independent of larval abundance. Thus, the period between the late larval and early juvenile stage appeared to be critical for sprat recruitment.

abstract = {The GLOBEC Germany program (2002-2007) had the ambitious goal to resolve the processes impacting the recruitment dynamics of Baltic sprat (. Sprattus sprattus L.) by examining various factors affecting early life history stages. At the start of the research program, a number of general recruitment hypotheses were formulated, i.e. focusing on (1) predation, (2) food availability, (3) physical parameters, (4) the impact of current systems, and finally (5) the importance of top-down vs bottom-up effects. The present study synthesizes the results of field sampling (2002 and 2003), laboratory experiments, and modeling studies to re-evaluate these hypotheses for the Baltic sprat stock. Recruitment success was quite different in the 2. years investigated. Despite a lower spawning stock biomass in 2003, the total number of recruits was almost 2-fold higher that year compared to 2002. The higher recruitment success in 2003 could be attributed to enhanced survival success during the post-larval/juvenile stage, a life phase that appears to be critical for recruitment dynamics. In the state of the Baltic ecosystem during the period of investigation, we consider bottom-up control (e.g. temperature, prey abundance) to be more important than top-down control (predation mortality). This ranking in importance does not vary seasonally. Prevailing water circulation patterns and the transport dynamics of larval cohorts have a strong influence on sprat recruitment success. Pronounced transport to coastal areas is detrimental for year-class strength particularly at high sprat stock sizes. A suggested mechanism is density-dependant regulation of survival via intra- and inter-specific competition for prey in coastal areas. A documented change in larval vertical migration behavior between the early 1990s and early 2000s increased the transport potential to the coast, strengthening the coupling between inter-annual differences in the magnitude and direction of wind-driven surface currents and year-to-year changes in reproductive success. However, due to the strong linkages and feed-back loops in the Baltic Sea food web, the most robust projections of the future strength of the Baltic sprat stock will need to take into account climate-driven changes in both abiotic (e.g., drift trajectories) and biotic (trophodynamic) factors. Although our understanding of processes affecting pre-recruit (larval) growth and survival has been advanced by the integrated research conducted within the GLOBEC Germany program, key mechanisms potentially affecting life stages outside of the spawning basins remain to be explored including the dynamics of coastal habitats of juveniles and the feeding and overwintering grounds of adults. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Fostering sustainable local social–ecological interactions playing out against a backdrop of larger-scale dynamics are ubiquitous challenges to natural resource management and biodiversity conservation. Social-ecological vulnerability assessments are highly relevant for place-based management and can help target and prioritize management actions. However, an understanding of how linked social-ecological vulnerabilities respond to external drivers is still lacking. This paper presents an approach that integrates the spatial and temporal dimensions into social-ecological vulnerability assessments, where social and ecological vulnerabilities are linked by a feedback loop. The approach is applied to the Moorea coral reef social-ecological system, which has been significantly influenced by major environmental and social drivers over the last decade. Temporal changes in linked social-ecological vulnerabilities are mapped before and after exposure to the multiple drivers. Nearly 23{\%} of households and 13{\%} of the reef area show low and decreasing vulnerability despite exposure. However, high and increasing levels of vulnerability were detected in 6{\%} of households and associated reefs after exposure to the drivers, providing early warnings of potentially unsustainable situations. Importantly, changes in ecological vulnerability did not propagate linearly to changes in social vulnerability. Similarly, hot spots of social vulnerability were not necessarily associated with hot spots of ecological vulnerability, highlighting the need to specifically adapt management interventions to local social-ecological settings. Mapping social-ecological dependencies in space and time provides communities and decision-makers with the information required to identify and prioritize management interventions while accounting for the effects of large-scale or external drivers.},

abstract = {Cold-water corals form high biodiversity habitats in the deep sea. They are generally long-lived, slow-growing, and thus particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic impact. We used high-definition imagery to quantify the impact and assess the recovery of deep-sea corals that were affected by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Over three hundred Paramuricea spp. colonies were imaged yearly between 2011 and 2017 at five sites, and the images were digitized to quantify health, hydroid overgrowth, identify branch loss, and track recovery patterns. Although the median level of impact decreased after 2011 at all impacted sites, it has been stable since then and remained higher than at the reference sites. Recovery depended on the initial level of impact to the colonies, which negatively affected the ability of individual branches to recover or remain healthy. The effect of initial impact on recovery between consecutive years was still visible seven years after the spill, indicating a long-term, non-acute, impact on the colonies. Injured corals were also more likely to lose branches, and branch loss was still significantly higher at some of the impacted sites between 2016 and 2017, indicating an ongoing effect of the spill, which may eventually lead to delayed mortality. The methodology we employed allows us to successfully detect small changes in the health of corals. We suggest the establishment of image-based coral-monitoring sites to collect baseline data on coral biology, assess the efficacy of Marine Protected Areas, and detect future anthropogenic impact to these vulnerable deep-sea ecosystems.},

abstract = {The Baltic Sea is a large brackish semienclosed sea whose species-poor fish community supports important commercial and recreational fisheries. Both the fish species and the fisheries are strongly affected by climate variations. These climatic effects and the underlying mechanisms are briefly reviewed. We then use recent regional -scale climate -ocean modelling results to consider how climate change during this century will affect the fish community of the Baltic and fisheries management. Expected climate changes in northern Europe will likely affect both the temperature and salinity of the Baltic, causing it to become warmer and fresher. As an estuarine ecosystem with large horizontal and vertical salinity gradients, biodiversity will be particularly sensitive to changes in salinity which can be expected as a consequence of altered precipitation patterns. Marine-tolerant species will be disadvantaged and their distributions will partially contract from the Baltic Sea; habitats of freshwater species will likely expand. Although some new species can be expected to immigrate because of an expected increase in sea temperature, only a few of these species will be able to successfully colonize the Baltic because of its low salinity. Fishing fleets which presently target marine species (e.g. cod, herring, sprat, plaice, sole) in the Baltic will likely have to relocate to more marine areas or switch to other species which tolerate decreasing salinities. Fishery management thresholds that trigger reductions in fishing quotas or fishery closures to conserve local populations (e.g. cod, salmon) will have to be reassessed as the ecological basis on which existing thresholds have been established changes, and new thresholds will have to be developed for immigrant species. The Baltic situation illustrates some of the uncertainties and complexities associated with forecasting how fish populations, communities and industries dependent on an estuarine ecosystem might respond to future climate change. {\textcopyright} 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Much of the Baltic Sea is currently classified as ‘affected by eutrophication'. The causes for this are twofold. First, current levels of nutrient inputs (nitrogen and phosphorus) from human activities exceed the natural processing capacity with an accumulation of nutrients in the Baltic Sea over the last 50–100 years. Secondly, the Baltic Sea is naturally susceptible to nutrient enrichment due to a combination of long retention times and stratification restricting ventilation of deep waters. Here, based on a unique data set collated from research activities and long-term monitoring programs, we report on the temporal and spatial trends of eutrophication status for the open Baltic Sea over a 112-year period using the HELCOM Eutrophication Assessment Tool (HEAT 3.0). Further, we analyse variation in the confidence of the eutrophication status assessment based on a systematic quantitative approach using coefficients of variation in the observations. The classifications in our assessment indicate that the first signs of eutrophication emerged in the mid-1950s and the central parts of the Baltic Sea changed from being unaffected by eutrophication to being affected. We document improvements in eutrophication status that are direct consequences of long-term efforts to reduce the inputs of nutrients. The reductions in both nitrogen and phosphorus loads have led to large-scale alleviation of eutrophication and to a healthier Baltic Sea. Reduced confidence in our assessment is seen more recently due to reductions in the scope of monitoring programs. Our study sets a baseline for implementation of the ecosystem-based management strategies and policies currently in place including the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directives and the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan.},

With worsening hypoxia, the role of sediments changes from nitrogen removal to nitrogen release as ammonium. At present, denitrification in the water column and sediments is equally important. Phosphorus is currently buried in sediments mainly in organic form, with an additional contribution of reduced Fe-phosphate minerals in the deep anoxic basins. Upon the transition to oxic conditions, a significant proportion of the organic phosphorus will be remineralized, with the phosphorus then being bound to iron oxides. This iron-oxide bound phosphorus is readily released to the water column upon the onset of hypoxia again. Important ecosystems services carried out by the benthic fauna, including biogeochemical feedback-loops and biomass production, are also lost with hypoxia.

@techreport{Boesch2006,
abstract = {EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Concerns about eutrophication in the seas around Sweden initially arose in the 1960s when long-term trends in declining oxygen concentrations were reported in the deep basins of the Baltic Sea, raising concerns about loss of fish habitat and the production of demersal fishes. Eutrophication is caused in large part by excessive inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to coastal fjords and archipelagos around Sweden, to the open waters of the Baltic Sea, and to the �resund, Kattegat, and Skagerrak. Nitrogen inputs to the Baltic Sea, for example, have increased four-fold and phosphorus inputs eight-fold since the mid-19th century. Objectionable symptoms of eutrophication considered herein are massive algal blooms including Cyanobacteria and other toxin producers, anoxic �dead� zones in bottom waters in deep basins, lower transparency, and, in shallower nearshore areas, the development of littoral mats of filamentous green algae and the disappearance of Fucus and eelgrass beds. In the spring of 2005 this committee was formed by invitation of the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency to examine publications and data for Swedish coastal seas and to make recommendations for efficiently reducing eutrophication. The committee was specifically requested to address whether reduced nitrogen discharges lead to increasing problems with Cyanobacteria blooms as a part of its study. To do this we analyzed scores of publications and recent manuscripts, heard presentations by prominent Swedish scientists with differing viewpoints, and explored a number of databases for long-term trends. It was concluded that different measures would be needed in different parts of the Baltic to reduce eutrophication most effectively. As a result, we have divided this report into three major sections: (1) the Swedish east coast, (2) the open Baltic Proper, and (3) the Swedish west coast. We chose not to evaluate the Bothnian Bay and the Bothnian Sea because these appear to be less affected by eutrophication at this time. Recommendations As the examples for Swedish seas illustrate, alleviating eutrophication should not be addressed as a single choice among controlling phosphorous only, nitrogen only, or nitrogen and phosphorus in combination. Limiting nutrients may differ from one environment to another, along spatial gradients, and over time. Furthermore, Swedish seas and coastal systems are bidirectionally interconnected and measures taken to reduce nutrient inputs into one can have spillover consequences to another. Reliance on simple decision metrics such as nitrogen:phosphorus ratios may lead to the wrong conclusions. With these considerations in mind, the committee makes the following recommendations. 1. Reduce phosphorus inputs to the open Baltic Proper. Views among Baltic scientists and, indeed, among the members of this panel, differ regarding the benefits or risks of reducing nitrogen inputs to the Baltic Proper; however there is broad agreement that phosphorus inputs should be reduced to alleviate 2 eutrophication, particularly the extensive Cyanobacteria blooms currently plaguing the sea. Efforts throughout the basin should begin with removing phosphorus from detergents and from point sources as the quickest way to decrease P loading. However, diffuse sources account for 60{\%} of anthropogenic P inputs; therefore, controls on diffuse sources of P should also be implemented. Preserving and, where possible, restoring nutrient-retentive features of the landscape should be an important part of a longer term nutrient control strategy. Additional point source phosphorus removal by Sweden alone is not likely to have a significant impact on the open Baltic Proper because the most important point sources of phosphorus loading are along the eastern and southern coasts of the Baltic. 2. Reduce atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Atmospheric deposition is the main external source of nitrogen to the Baltic Proper and the western seas of Sweden. So far, attempts to reduce atmospheric sources of nitrogen have had little effect on this loading. Reducing atmospheric deposition has benefits for terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems as well as the western seas. Efforts to reduce atmospheric deposition of nitrogen should be pursued, although without accompanying removal of phosphorus from land-based sources there is a risk of enhancing growth of bloom forming nitrogen-fixing Cyanobacteria in the Baltic Proper as reduced atmospheric inputs of nitrogen may give the Cyanobacteria an increasing advantage over other algal groups. 3. Reduce nitrogen inputs to the waters of the Swedish west coast. Reduction of eutrophication problems in the West Sea and associated coastal waters will require significant reductions in inputs of nitrogen. In contrast to the eastern coasts and the Baltic Proper, there do not appear to be risks of Cyanobacteria blooms. Reductions of phosphorus inputs would also have positive results because of the presently high levels of anthropogenic loading of both nutrients, but only if accompanied by nitrogen reductions. While reductions in point sources of nitrogen would contribute to achieving eutrophication reduction goals, these goals cannot be approached without significant reductions in diffuse sources and atmospheric deposition. Achieving these goals will require a focus on diffuse sources and atmospheric deposition at local and regional scales. 4. Appropriately reduce nutrient inputs in enrichment-sensitive areas of the Swedish east coast. Phosphorus is now removed at most sewage treatment plants in Sweden, but diffuse sources are still important in some areas. Further reduction of external P loading will require addressing anthropogenic non-point sources of P. While P removal from the Stockholm STPs by 1970 led to significant reductions in algal biomass and blooms of Cyanobacteria, internal loading of P from bottom sediments, although poorly defined, is currently a substantial source of P. Increased oxygen concentrations reduce the rate of release of P from sediments and thereby affect the longer-term recovery from eutrophication, because P inputs from STPs are now small. The Committee is divided 3 about the benefits of nitrogen removal to the fjords and coastal waters of the Swedish east coast. Some conclude that where eutrophication effects exist removal of nitrogen is warranted and consider that its effects have been clearly demonstrated. At the same time they recognize that extensive nitrogen removal may stimulate nitrogen-fixing Cyanobacteria if not otherwise limited by phosphorus. Other members consider that the available data do not demonstrate benefits of nitrogen reduction in these waters and that emphasis should continue to be directed at phosphorus removal only until there is a more convincing case for the benefits of nitrogen removal.},

Driven by high resolution atmospheric forcing fields (HiResAFF), BALTSEM reproduces dynamics of salinity, temperature, and maximum ice extent. Nutrient loads have been increasing with a noteworthy acceleration from the 1950s until peak values around 1980 followed by a decrease continuing up to present. BALTSEM shows a delayed response to the massive load increase with most eutrophic conditions occurring only at the end of the simulation. This is accompanied by an intensification of the pelagic cycling driven by a shift from spring to summer primary production. The simulation indicates that no improvement in water quality of the Baltic Sea compared to its present state can be expected from the decrease in nutrient loads in recent decades. {\textcopyright} 2012 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.},

Since the first papers on the subject appeared, two perspectives have developed to describe how communities shift from one stable state to another. One assumes a constant environment with shifts in variables such as population density, and the other anticipates changes to underlying parameters or environmental "drivers". We review the theory behind alternative stable states and examine to what extent these perspectives are the same, and in what ways they differ.

@article{Saraiva2019,
abstract = {Many coastal seas worldwide are affected by human impacts such as eutrophication causing, inter alia, oxygen depletion, and extensive areas of hypoxia. Depending on the region, global warming may reinforce these environmental changes by reducing air-sea oxygen fluxes, intensifying internal nutrient cycling, and increasing river-borne nutrient loads. The development of appropriate management plans to effectively protect the marine environment requires projections of future marine ecosystem states. However, projections with regional climate models commonly suffer from shortcomings in the driving global General Circulation Models (GCMs). The differing sensitivities of GCMs to increased greenhouse gas concentrations affect regional projections considerably. In this study, we focused on one of the most threatened coastal seas, the Baltic Sea, and estimated uncertainties in projections due to climate model deficiencies and due to unknown future greenhouse gas concentration, nutrient load and sea level rise scenarios. To address the latter, simulations of the period 1975–2098 were performed using the initial conditions from an earlier reconstruction with the same Baltic Sea model (starting in 1850). To estimate the impacts of climate model uncertainties, dynamical downscaling experiments with four driving global models were carried out for two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios and for three nutrient load scenarios, covering the plausible range between low and high loads. The results suggest that changes in nutrient supply, in particular phosphorus, control the long-term (centennial) response of eutrophication, biogeochemical fluxes and oxygen conditions in the deep water. The analysis of simulated primary production, nitrogen fixation, and hypoxic areas shows that uncertainties caused by the various nutrient load scenarios are greater than the uncertainties due to climate model uncertainties and future greenhouse gas concentrations. In all scenario simulations, a proposed nutrient load abatement strategy, i.e., the Baltic Sea Action Plan, will lead to a significant improvement in the overall environmental state. However, the projections cannot provide detailed information on the timing and the reductions of future hypoxic areas, due to uncertainties in salinity projections caused by uncertainties in projections of the regional water cycle and of the mean sea level outside the model domain.},

abstract = {Abrupt transitions of regional climate in response to the gradual rise in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are notoriously difficult to foresee. However, such events could be particularly challenging in view of the capacity required for society and ecosystems to adapt to them. We present, to our knowledge, the first systematic screening of the massive climate model ensemble informing the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, and reveal evidence of 37 forced regional abrupt changes in the ocean, sea ice, snow cover, permafrost, and terrestrial biosphere that arise after a certain global temperature increase. Eighteen out of 37 events occur for global warming levels of less than 2, a threshold sometimes presented as a safe limit. Although most models predict one or more such events, any specific occurrence typically appears in only a few models. We find no compelling evidence for a general relation between the overall number of abrupt shifts and the level of global warming. However, we do note that abrupt changes in ocean circulation occur more often for moderate warming (less than 2), whereas over land they occurmore often forwarming larger than 2. Using a basic proportion test, however, we find that the number of abrupt shifts identified in Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenarios is significantly larger than in other scenarios of lower radiative forcing. This suggests the potential for a gradual trend of destabilization of the climate with respect to such shifts, due to increasing global mean temperature change.},

abstract = {The ‘Great Acceleration' graphs, originally published in 2004 to show socio-economic and Earth System trends from 1750 to 2000, have now been updated to 2010. In the graphs of socio-economic trends, where the data permit, the activity of the wealthy (OECD) countries, those countries with emerging economies, and the rest of the world have now been differentiated. The dominant feature of the socio-economic trends is that the economic activity of the human enterprise continues to grow at a rapid rate. However, the differentiated graphs clearly show that strong equity issues are masked by considering global aggregates only. Most of the population growth since 1950 has been in the non-OECD world but the world's economy (GDP), and hence consumption, is still strongly dominated by the OECD world. The Earth System indicators, in general, continued their long-term, post-industrial rise, although a few, such as atmospheric methane concentration and stratospheric ozone loss, showed a slowing or apparent stabilisation over the past decade. The post-1950 acceleration in the Earth System indicators remains clear. Only beyond the mid-20th century is there clear evidence for fundamental shifts in the state and functioning of the Earth System that are beyond the range of variability of the Holocene and driven by human activities. Thus, of all the candidates for a start date for the Anthropocene, the beginning of the Great Acceleration is by far the most convincing from an Earth System science perspective.},

We require better understanding of hyperkeystone interaction chains most urgently, especially for marine species and terrestrial large carnivores, which experience relatively higher exploitation rates than other species.

abstract = {Marine ecosystems can experience regime shifts, in which they shift from being organized around one set of mutually reinforcing structures and processes to another. Anthropogenic global change has broadly increased a wide variety of processes that can drive regime shifts. To assess the vulnerability of marine ecosystems to such shifts and their potential consequences, we reviewed the scientific literature for 13 types of marine regime shifts and used networks to conduct an analysis of co-occurrence of drivers and ecosystem service impacts. We found that regime shifts are caused by multiple drivers and have multiple consequences that co-occur in a non-random pattern. Drivers related to food production, climate change and coastal development are the most common co-occurring causes of regime shifts, while cultural services, biodiversity and primary production are the most common cluster of ecosystem services affected. These clusters prioritize sets of drivers for management and highlight the need for coordinated actions across multiple drivers and scales to reduce the risk of marine regime shifts. Managerial strategies are likely to fail if they only address well-understood or data-rich variables, and international cooperation and polycentric institutions will be critical to implement and coordinate action across the scales at which different drivers operate. By better understanding these underlying patterns, we hope to inform the development of managerial strategies to reduce the risk of high-impact marine regime shifts, especially for areas of the world where data are not available or monitoring programmes are not in place.},

abstract = {Early warning signals (EWS) might dramatically improve our ability to manage nonlinear ecological change. However, the degree to which theoretical EWS predictions are supported in empirical systems remains unclear. The goal of this study is to make recommendations for identifying the types of ecological transitions that are expected to show EWS. We conducted a review and meta-analysis of published studies and comparative analysis of eight northeast Pacific Ocean time series to illustrate the importance of testing for nonlinearity in empirical EWS studies. We found that published studies demonstrating nonlinearity in ecosystem dynamics are more likely to support EWS predictions than studies with linear or undetermined dynamics. The northeast Pacific time series in our analysis were often too short for formal tests of nonlinearity, a common problem in empirical studies. To assess the evidence for nonlinear dynamics in these data, we tested for state-dependent driver-response relationships consistent with hysteresis, a central feature of nonlinear ecological models. This analysis supported the results of the literature metaanalysis. Four time series with driver-response relationships consistent with hysteresis generally supported theoretical EWS predictions, while four without evidence of hysteresis failed to support EWS predictions. Theoretical support for EWS is largely generated from nonlinear models, and we conclude that tests for either nonlinear dynamics or hysteresis are needed before employing EWS.},

Verifying this diagnosis is important because it implies a radically different view on management options, and on the potential effects of global change on such ecosystems. For instance, it implies that gradual changes in temperature or other factors might have little effect until a threshold is reached at which a large shift occurs that might be difficult to reverse. Strategies to assess whether alternative stable states are present are now converging in fields as disparate as desertification, limnology, oceanography and climatology.

These findings offer a way to anticipate major ecosystem changes and to propose adaptive strategies for marine exploited resources such as cod in order to minimize social and economic consequences. {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {We explore the risk that self-reinforcing feedbacks could push the Earth System toward a planetary threshold that, if crossed, could prevent stabilization of the climate at intermediate temperature rises and cause continued warming on a “Hothouse Earth” pathway even as human emissions are reduced. Crossing the threshold would lead to a much higher global average temperature than any interglacial in the past 1.2 million years and to sea levels significantly higher than at any time in the Holocene. We examine the evidence that such a threshold might exist and where it might be. If the threshold is crossed, the resulting trajectory would likely cause serious disruptions to ecosystems, society, and economies. Collective human action is required to steer the Earth System away from a potential threshold and stabilize it in a habitable interglacial-like state. Such action entails stewardship of the entire Earth System—biosphere, climate, and societies—and could include decarbonization of the global economy, enhancement of biosphere carbon sinks, behavioral changes, technological innovations, new governance arrangements, and transformed social values.},

abstract = {The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is a system of ocean currents that has an essential role in Earth's climate, redistributing heat and influencing the carbon cycle1, 2. The AMOC has been shown to be weakening in recent years 1 ; this decline may reflect decadal-scale variability in convection in the Labrador Sea, but short observational datasets preclude a longer-term perspective on the modern state and variability of Labrador Sea convection and the AMOC1, 3–5. Here we provide several lines of palaeo-oceanographic evidence that Labrador Sea deep convection and the AMOC have been anomalously weak over the past 150 years or so (since the end of the Little Ice Age, LIA, approximately ad 1850) compared with the preceding 1,500 years. Our palaeoclimate reconstructions indicate that the transition occurred either as a predominantly abrupt shift towards the end of the LIA, or as a more gradual, continued decline over the past 150 years; this ambiguity probably arises from non-AMOC influences on the various proxies or from the different sensitivities of these proxies to individual components of the AMOC. We suggest that enhanced freshwater fluxes from the Arctic and Nordic seas towards the end of the LIA—sourced from melting glaciers and thickened sea ice that developed earlier in the LIA—weakened Labrador Sea convection and the AMOC. The lack of a subsequent recovery may have resulted from hysteresis or from twentieth-century melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet 6 . Our results suggest that recent decadal variability in Labrador Sea convection and the AMOC has occurred during an atypical, weak background state. Future work should aim to constrain the roles of internal climate variability and early anthropogenic forcing in the AMOC weakening described here.},

abstract = {Finding suitable state indicators is challenging and cumbersome in stochastic and complex ecological systems. Typically, a great focus is given to criteria such as data availability, scientific basis, or measurability. Features associated with the indicator's performance such as sensitivity or robustness are often neglected due to the lack of quantitative validation tools. In this paper, we present a simple but flexible framework for selecting and validating the performance of food web indicators. In specific, we suggest a 7-step process in which indicator performances at a regional scale are quantified and visualized allowing for the selection of complementary indicator suites. We demonstrate its application by comparing the performance of pelagic food web indicators for three basins of the Baltic Sea and by assessing the food web status based on selected indicator suites. Our analysis sheds light on spatial differences in indicator performances with respect to direct and indirect pressures, the role of non-linearity and non-additivity in pressure responses, as well as relationships between indicators caused by species interactions. Moreover, our results suggest that the present food web states in the Bornholm and Gotland basins of the Baltic Sea deviate distinctly from an earlier reference period. We advocate the use of our quantitative framework as decision-support tool for selecting suites of complementary indicators under given management schemes such as the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive.},

Here we report on a new global system for coastal and shelf areas: the Marine Ecoregions of the World, or MEOW, a nested system of 12 realms, 62 provinces, and 232 ecoregions. This system provides considerably better spatial resolution than earlier global systems, yet it preserves many common elements and can be cross-referenced to many regional biogeographic classifications.

The application of biodiversity indicators to assess the status of species, habitats, and functional diversity in marine conservation and policy, however, is still developing and multiple indicator roles and features are emerging. For example, some operational biodiversity indicators trigger management action when a threshold is reached, while others play an interpretive, or surveillance, role in informing management. Links between biodiversity indicators and the pressures affecting them are frequently unclear as links can be obscured by environmental change, data limitations, food web dynamics, or the cumulative effects of multiple pressures. In practice, the application of biodiversity indicators to meet marine conservation policy and management demands is developing rapidly in the management realm, with a lag before academic publication detailing indicator development. Making best use of biodiversity indicators depends on sharing and synthesizing cutting-edge knowledge and experience. Using lessons learned from the application of biodiversity indicators in policy and management from around the globe, we define the concept of 'biodiversity indicators,' explore barriers to their use and potential solutions, and outline strategies for their effective communication to decision-makers.},

abstract = {In tropical prawn (shrimp) trawl fisheries it is daunting to assess the sustainability of bycatch species because they are diverse and there is little historical and biological information for quantitative stock assessments. We developed a process to examine the likely impact of prawn trawling on the sustainability of bycatch species and applied this to fish bycatch in the Australian Northern Prawn Fishery. The 411 fish bycatch species were ranked with respect to biological and ecological criteria that contributed to two overriding characteristics, namely first, their susceptibility to capture and mortality due to prawn trawling, and second the population's capacity to recover after depletion. The rank of each species on these two characteristics determined its relative capacity to sustain trawling, and therefore its priority for research and management. Species that were the least likely to be sustainable came from the families Apogonidae, Ariidae, Bathysauridae, Callionymidae, Congridae, Diodontidae, Labridae, Opisthognathidae, Plotosidae, Synodontidae and Tetraodontidae. These species are highly susceptible to capture by trawls, they are benthic or demersal, their primary habitat is soft sediments, and their diet may include prawns. The recovery capacity of these species is also low, with the estimated removal rate by trawling high. The species that were the most likely to be sustainable came from the families Carangidae, Clupeidae, Ephippidae, Scombridae, Sphyraenidae and Terapontidae. They are less susceptible to capture by trawls, they are generally pelagic, their primary habitat is not in trawl grounds, and they have a broad depth distribution and range in the fishery. These species also have a greater capacity to recover, as most individuals have bred before capture, and a low estimated removal rate by trawling. The final ranking of the species must be used with caution because of the assumptions made in the process. However, the process is a valuable first step towards ensuring the sustainability of the bycatch species. Because of the simplicity of the process, it can be readily used in fisheries, particularly those with diverse bycatch, to manage the sustainability of their bycatch.},

To assist the regional fishery management councils in determining vulnerability, NMFS elected to use a modified version of a productivity and susceptibility analysis (PSA) because it can be based on qualitative data, has a history of use in other fisheries, and is recommended by several organizations as a reasonable approach for evaluating risk. A number of productivity and susceptibility attributes for a stock are used in a PSA and from these attributes, index scores and measures of uncertainty are computed and graphically displayed. To demonstrate the utility of the resulting vulnerability evaluation, we evaluated six U.S. fisheries targeting 162 stocks that exhibited varying degrees of productivity and susceptibility, and for which data quality varied. Overall, the PSA was capable of differentiating the vulnerability of stocks along the gradient of susceptibility and productivity indices, although fixed thresholds separating low-, moderate-, and highly vulnerable species were not observed. The PSA can be used as a flexible tool that can incorporate regional-specific information on fishery and management activity.},

Using these data, two guideline values (an effects range-low and an effects range-median) were determined for nine trace metals, total PCBs, two pesticides, 13 polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and three classes of PAHs. The two values defined concentration ranges that were: (1) rarely, (2) occasionally, or (3) frequently associated with adverse effects. The values generally agreed within a factor of 3 or less with those developed with the same methods applied to other data and to those developed with other effects-based methods. The incidence of adverse effects was quantified within each of the three concentration ranges as the number of cases in which effects were observed divided by the total number of observations. The incidence of effects increased markedly with increasing concentrations of all of the individual PAHs, the three classes of PAHs, and most of the trace metals. Relatively poor relationships were observed between the incidence of effects and the concentrations of mercury, nickel, total PCB, total DDT and p,p′-DDE. Based upon this evaluation, the approach provided reliable guidelines for use in sediment quality assessments.

abstract = {Marine ecosystems are threatened by a suite of anthropogenic stressors. Mitigating multiple threats is a daunting task, particularly when funding constraints limit the number of threats that can be addressed. Threats are typically assessed and prioritized via expert opinion workshops that often leave no record of the rationale for decisions, making it difficult to update recommendations with new information. We devised a transparent, repeatable, and modifiable method for collecting expert opinion that describes and documents how threats affect marine ecosystems. Experts were asked to assess the functional impact, scale, and frequency of a threat to an ecosystem; the resistance and recovery time of an ecosystem to a threat; and the certainty of these estimates. To quantify impacts of 38 distinct anthropogenic threats on 23 marine ecosystems, we surveyed 135 experts from 19 different countries. Survey results showed that all ecosystems are threatened by at least nine threats and that nine ecosystems are threatened by {\textgreater}90{\%} of existing threats. The greatest threats (highest impact scores) were increasing sea temperature, demersal destructive fishing, and point-source organic pollution. Rocky reef, coral reef, hard-shelf, mangrove, and offshore epipelagic ecosystems were identified as the most threatened. These general results, however, may be partly influenced by the specific expertise and geography of respondents, and should be interpreted with caution. This approach to threat analysis can identify the greatest threats (globally or locally), most widespread threats, most (or least) sensitive ecosystems, most (or least) threatened ecosystems, and other metrics of conservation value. Additionally, it can be easily modified, updated as new data become available, and scaled to local or regional settings, which would facilitate informed and transparent conservation priority setting. {\textcopyright} 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract = {Humans impact natural systems in a multitude of ways, yet the cumulative effect of multiple stressors on ecological communities remains largely unknown. Here we synthesized 171 studies that manipulated two or more stressors in marine and coastal systems and found that cumulative effects in individual studies were additive (26{\%}), synergistic (36{\%}), and antagonistic (38{\%}). The overall interaction effect across all studies was synergistic, but interaction type varied by response level (community: antagonistic, population: synergistic), trophic level (autotrophs: antagonistic, heterotrophs: synergistic), and specific stressor pair (seven pairs additive, three pairs each synergistic and antagonistic). Addition of a third stressor changed interaction effects significantly in two-thirds of all cases and doubled the number of synergistic interactions. Given that most studies were performed in laboratories where stressor effects can be carefully isolated, these three-stressor results suggest that synergies may be quite common in nature where more than two stressors almost always coexist. While significant gaps exist in multiple stressor research, our results suggest an immediate need to account for stressor interactions in ecological studies and conservation planning. {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

Models of population-level effects of contaminants can integrate information from lower levels of biological organization and feed that information into higher-level community and ecosystem models. As individual-level endpoints are used to predict population responses, this requires that biological responses at lower levels of organization be translated into a form that is usable by the population modeler. In the current study, we describe how mechanistic data, as captured in adverse outcome pathways (AOPs), can be translated into modeling focused on population-level risk assessments. First, we describe the regulatory context surrounding population modeling, risk assessment and the emerging role of AOPs. Then we present a succinct overview of different approaches to population modeling and discuss the types of data needed for these models. We describe how different key biological processes measured at the level of the individual serve as the linkage, or bridge, between AOPs and predictions of population status, including consideration of community-level interactions and genetic adaptation. Several case examples illustrate the potential for use of AOPs in population modeling and predictive ecotoxicology. Finally, we make recommendations for focusing toxicity studies to produce the quantitative data needed to define AOPs and to facilitate their incorporation into population modeling. {\textcopyright} 2010 SETAC.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the application of ecological vulnerability analysis in risk assessment and describes new developments in methodology. For generic non-site-specific assessments (e.g. for the requirements of most European directives on dangerous chemicals) risk is characterised just on the basis of the ratio between an effect indicator and an exposure indicator. However, when the actual risk for a specific ecosystem is desired, the concept of ecological vulnerability may be more appropriate. This calls for a change in thinking, from sensitivity at the organism level to vulnerability at higher organization levels, and thus forms the link from laboratory toxicology to field effects at population, community or ecosystem level. To do so, biological and ecological characteristics of the ecosystems under concern are needed to estimate the ecological vulnerability.In this review we describe different vulnerability analysis methods developed for populations (of a single species), communities (consisting of different populations of species) and ecosystems (community and habitat combined). We also give some examples of methods developed for socio-ecological systems. Aspects that all methods share are the use of expert judgment, the input of stakeholders, ranking and mapping of the results, and the qualitative nature of the results.A new general framework is presented to guide future ecological vulnerability analysis. This framework can be used as part of ecological risk assessment, but also in risk management. We conclude that the further quantification of ecological vulnerability is a valuable contribution to vulnerability assessment. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

In the present study, the impacts of sea ice, extreme light regime, various polar region-specific physiological characteristics in polar cod (Boreogadus saida) and their effects on xenobiotic distribution and metabolism are studied. A Bayesian belief network is used to model individual fish toxicity. The enzyme activity in the fish liver and other pertinent organs is used as a proxy for cellular damage and repair and is subsequently linked to toxicity in polar cod. Seasonal baseline variation in enzyme production is also taken into consideration. The model estimates the probability of exposure concentration to cause cytotoxicity and circumvents the need to use the traditionally obtained No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC). Instead, it uses biotransformation enzyme activity as a basis to estimate the probability of individual cell damages.},

abstract = {There is an increasing need to evaluate the links between the social and ecological dimensions of human vulnerability to climate change. We use an empirical case study of 12 coastal communities and associated coral reefs in Kenya to assess and compare five key ecological and social components of the vulnerability of coastal social-ecological systems to temperature induced coral mortality [specifically: 1) environmental exposure; 2) ecological sensitivity; 3) ecological recovery potential; 4) social sensitivity; and 5) social adaptive capacity]. We examined whether ecological components of vulnerability varied between government operated no-take marine reserves, community-based reserves, and openly fished areas. Overall, fished sites were marginally more vulnerable than community-based and government marine reserves. Social sensitivity was indicated by the occupational composition of each community, including the importance of fishing relative to other occupations, as well as the susceptibility of different fishing gears to the effects of coral bleaching on target fish species. Key components of social adaptive capacity varied considerably between the communities. Together, these results show that different communities have relative strengths and weaknesses in terms of social-ecological vulnerability to climate change.},

abstract = {Qualitative network analyses provide a broad range of advantages for formulating ideas and testing understanding of ecosystem function, for exploring feedback dynamics, and for making qualitative predictions in cases where data are limited. They have been applied to a wide range of ecological questions, including exploration of the implications of uncertainty about fundamental system structure. However, we argue that questions regarding model uncertainty in qualitative network analyses have been under-explored, and that there is a need for a coherent framework for evaluating uncertainty. To address this issue, we have developed a Bayesian framework for interpreting uncertainty that can be applied when comparing and evaluating the characteristics and behavior of alternative model formulations. Specifically, we recognize that results from previously developed simulation approaches to qualitative modeling can be interpreted as marginal likelihoods that translate to Bayes factors for model comparison. We then test and extend our Bayesian interpretation of qualitative model results to address comparisons both between and within alternative models. With the use of examples, we demonstrate how our Bayesian framework for interpretation can improve the application of qualitative modeling for addressing uncertainty about the structure and function of ecological networks. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

However, there are few examples of work that translates this approach into climate change adaptation practice, in order to demonstrate the practical utility of following a risk-based approach to adapting to climate change. The paper explores critically the differing conceptions of vulnerability and risk across the literature relating to disaster risk management and climate change adaptation. The paper also examines a selection of spatially focused climate change vulnerability and risk assessment methodologies in this context. In doing so, we identify issues with the availability of spatial data to enable spatial risk-based climate change assessments. We argue that the concept of risk is potentially favorable in helping cities to understand the challenges posed by climate change, identify adaptation options, and build resilience to the changing climate. However, we suggest that change is needed in the way that practitioners and policymakers engage with risk-based concepts if they are to be embed into climate change adaptation activities.},

abstract = {The public and the decision and policy makers who serve them too often have a view of community risks that is influenced and distorted significantly by media exposure and common misconceptions. The regulators and managers, responsible for planning and coordination of a community's mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery efforts, are originated from a variety of disciplines and levels of education. Not only must these individuals deal with the misconceptions of their communities, but also frequently lack a basic methodology for the assessment of risks. The effective planning of mitigation and response are, however, directly dependent upon the understanding of the complexities, types, and nature of risks faced by the community, determining the susceptible areas, and conceptualizing human vulnerability. In this study, a review of the existing literature on both the conceptual underpinnings of risk and its assessment is attempted. A standardized framework is proposed for use by all emergency managers, regardless of training or education. This framework consists of the numerical ranking of the frequency of the event in the community, multiplied by a numerical ranking of the severity or magnitude of an event in a given community, based upon the potential impact characteristics of a 'worst-case' scenario. This figure is then multiplied by a numerical ranking indicating the Social Consequence; a combination of community perception of risk level and collective will to address the problem. The resulting score, which is not strictly scientific, would permit emergency managers from a variety of backgrounds to compare levels of community exposure to such disparate events as hazardous materials spills and tornadoes, and to set priorities for both mitigation efforts and for the acquisition of response needs, within the availability of community resources.},

Methods of risk assessment are outlined and a discussion is given on how statistics on physical elements and their damage vulnerability are utilized in an insurance program that currently covers many of the natural hazards in the United States. In this paper, emphasis is on insured physical elements and their vulnerabilities to the wind hazard because other papers in this series discuss the national flood insurance program in the United States and risk assessment of the earthquake hazard.

abstract = {Predicting the effects of aquaculture development for coastal ecosystems remains challenging, particularly for data-limited systems, and tools that account for complex ecological interactions are needed to support ecosystem approaches to aquaculture. Here, we used qualitative network models (QNMs) to examine the potential community effects of increasing bivalve aquaculture in South Puget Sound, a large estuarine system in Washington, United States. QNMs are formalized conceptual models that require only a qualitative understanding of how variables composing a system interact (that is, the sign of interactions: +, –, and 0) and are therefore well-suited to data-limited systems. Specifically, we examined community-wide responses to scenarios in which bivalve cultivation effort increased for three different bivalve species (Manila clam Venerupis philippinarum, Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, and geoduck Panopea generosa). Further, we evaluated community-wide responses to the removal of benthic bivalve predators, a future increase in nutrient loadings, and combinations of these scenarios acting simultaneously. The scenarios enabled identification of potential trade-offs between increased aquaculture and shifts in the abundance of community members and assessment of the possible effects of different management actions. We also analysed the QNM to identify key interactions that influence the sign outcome of community responses to press perturbations, highlighting potential points for management intervention and linkages deserving of more focused quantitative study. QNMs are mathematically robust and highly flexible, but remain underutilized. We suggest that they may serve as valuable tools for supporting ecosystem approaches to aquaculture.},

The combination of processes (climate drivers and hazards) leading to a significant impact is referred to as a 'compound event'. Traditional risk assessment methods typically only consider one driver and/or hazard at a time, potentially leading to underestimation of risk, as the processes that cause extreme events often interact and are spatially and/or temporally dependent. Here we show how a better understanding of compound events may improve projections of potential high-impact events, and can provide a bridge between climate scientists, engineers, social scientists, impact modellers and decision-makers, who need to work closely together to understand these complex events.},

abstract = {A procedure is presented that allows monitoring of the dynamic regime of pelagic ecosystems in the North Atlantic Ocean. It uses a diversity index (mean number of species per continuous plankton recorder [CPR] sample) and species assemblage indicators calculated from all calanoid copepods (108 species) identified by the CPR survey since 1958. In any region of the North Atlantic covered by the CPR survey, the procedure calculates the values of these ecosystem indicators using a constant number of samples, selected randomly, and checks any bias associated with the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the sampling. The procedure is described and illustrated in this study using CPR data in the central North Sea. The usefulness of this tool is demonstrated by a study of the sensitivity of the indicators to the number of CPR samples employed in the estimation of monthly or annual means. Firstly, it is shown that on an annual scale the procedure improves the quality of estimations. However, when long-term changes of a plankton indicator are examined for a particular month, it is crucial to use an appropriate number of CPR samples to detect a significant link between the biological and hydro-climatic environment. Secondly, the importance of using species assemblage indicators is demonstrated. They allowed the detection and the ecological interpretation of both episodic events and the regime shift in the central North Sea. It is shown that the regime shift in the North Sea had a strong impact on plankton community structure and was marked by an increase in diversity related to a progressive increase in warm-water species and a decrease in cold-water species. This study also has important implications for researchers using the CPR data. It demonstrates the robustness of the CPR data, but on the other hand also shows that the spatial and temporal heterogeneity should be assessed with care before interpreting the long-term changes of a CPR-derived plankton indicator.},

abstract = {1. Climate change impacts have been observed on individual species and species subsets; however, it remains to be seen whether there are systematic, coherent assemblage-wide responses to climate change that could be used as a representative indicator of changing biological state. 2. European shelf seas are warming faster than the adjacent land masses and faster than the global average. We explore the year-by-year distributional response of North Sea bottom-dwelling (demersal) fishes to temperature change over the 25 years from 1980 to 2004. The centres of latitudinal and depth distributions of 28 fishes were estimated from species-abundance-location data collected on an annual fish monitoring survey. 3. Individual species responses were aggregated into 19 assemblages reflecting physiology (thermal preference and range), ecology (body size and abundance-occupancy patterns), biogeography (northern, southern and presence of range boundaries), and susceptibility to human impact (fishery target, bycatch and non-target species). 4. North Sea winter bottom temperature has increased by 1.6°C over 25 years, with a 1°C increase in 1988-1989 alone. During this period, the whole demersal fish assemblage deepened by ∼3.6 m decade-1 and the deepening was coherent for most assemblages. 5. The latitudinal response to warming was heterogeneous, and reflects (i) a northward shift in the mean latitude of abundant, widespread thermal specialists, and (ii) the southward shift of relatively small, abundant southerly species with limited occupancy and a northern range boundary in the North Sea. 6. Synthesis and applications. The deepening of North Sea bottom-dwelling fishes in response to climate change is the marine analogue of the upward movement of terrestrial species to higher altitudes. The assemblage-level depth responses, and both latitudinal responses, covary with temperature and environmental variability in a manner diagnostic of a climate change impact. The deepening of the demersal fish assemblage in response to temperature could be used as a biotic indicator of the effects of climate change in the North Sea and other semi-enclosed seas. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {Arctic marine ecosystems are warming twice as fast as the global average. As a consequence of warming, many incoming species experience increasing abundances and expanding distribution ranges in the Arctic. The Arctic is expected to have the largest species turnover with regard to invading and locally extinct species, with a modelled invasion intensity of five times the global average. Studies in this region might therefore give valuable insights into community-wide shifts of species driven by climate warming. We found that the recent warming in the Barents Sea has led to a change in spatial distribution of fish communities, with boreal communities expanding northwards at a pace reflecting the local climate velocities. Increased abundance and distribution areas of large, migratory fish predators explain the observed community-wide distributional shifts. These shifts change the ecological interactions experienced by Arctic fish species. The Arctic shelf fish community retracted northwards to deeper areas bordering the deep polar basin. Depth might limit further retraction of some of the fish species in the Arctic shelf community. We conclude that climate warming is inducing structural change over large spatial scales at high latitudes, leading to a borealization of fish communities in the Arctic.},

abstract = {Implementing more holistic forms of fisheries management (e.g. Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD), Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management) usually increases the number and scope of impacts requiring assessment. This study examined the effectiveness of a qualitative risk assessment process, developed as part of a National ESD framework, for prioritizing issues across the seven most valuable Western Australian commercial fisheries. Structured stakeholder workshops were used to identify issues across three ecological areas: retained species (i.e. target and by-product), non-retained (i.e. discarded and protected) species, and the broader ecosystem for each fishery. The risk associated with each issue was assessed using one of five sets of consequence criteria specifically developed to cover fishery-related impacts. The risk scores, for which suitably detailed justifications were written, determined the level of reporting and management required for each issue. Despite an additional 96 “non-target species issues” being identified at the workshops from a total of 115 issues, of the 27 issues requiring explicit management actions, just six new issues were added by this process. In addition, it identified where modifications of some of the existing arrangements were necessary. Finally, the system significantly improved stakeholder involvement and therefore acceptance of the outcomes. Given this success, risk assessment has now been applied to all Western Australia's export fisheries and to the development or review of many other systems, thereby improving the entire management process.},

abstract = {The number of variables involved in the monitoring of an ecosystem can be high and often one of the first stages in the analysis is to reduce the number of variables. We describe a method developed for geological purposes, using the information theory, that enables selection of the most relevant variables. This technique also allows the examination of the asymmetrical relationships between variables. Applied to a set of physical and biological variables (plankton assemblages in four areas of the North Sea), the method shows that biological variables are more informative than physical variables although the controlling factors are mainly physical (sea surface temperature in winter and spring). Among biological variables, diversity measures and warm-water species assemblages are informative for the state of the North Sea pelagic ecosystems while among physical variables sea surface temperature in late winter and early spring are highly informative. Although often used in bioclimatology, the utilisation of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index does not seem to provide a lot of information. The method reveals that only the extreme states of this index has an influence on North Sea pelagic ecosystems. The substantial and persistent changes that were detected in the dynamic regime of the North Sea ecosystems and called regime shift are detected by the method and corresponds to the timing of other shifts described in the literature for some European Systems such as the Baltic and the Mediterranean Sea when both physical and biological variables are considered. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Regime shift and principal component analysis of a spatially disaggregated database capturing time-series of climatic, nutrient and plankton variables in the North Sea revealed considerable covariance between groups of ecosystem indicators. Plankton and climate time-series span the period 1958-2003, those of nutrients start in 1980. In both regions, the period from 1989 to 2001 identified in principal component 1 had warmer surface waters, higher Atlantic inflow and stronger winds, than the periods before or after. However, it was preceded by a regime shift in both open (PC2) and coastal (PC3) waters during 1977 towards more hours of sunlight and higher water temperature, which lasted until 1997. The relative influence of nutrient availability and climatic forcing differed between open and coastal North Sea regions. Inter-annual variability in phytoplankton dynamics of the open North Sea was primarily regulated by climatic forcing, specifically by sea surface temperature, Atlantic inflow and co-varying wind stress and NAO. Coastal phytoplankton variability, however, was regulated by insolation and sea surface temperature, as well as Si availability, but not by N or P. Regime shifts in principal components of hydrographic and climatic variables (explaining 55 and 61{\%} of the variance in coastal and open water variables) were detected using Rodionov's sequential t-test. These shifts in hydroclimatic variables which occurred around 1977, 1989, 1997 and 2001, were synchronized in open and coastal waters, and were tracked by open water chlorophyll and copepods, but not by coastal plankton. North-central-south or open-coastal spatial breakdowns of the North Sea explained similar amounts of variability in most ecosystem indicators with the exception of diatom abundance and chlorophyll concentration, which were clearly better explained using the open-coastal configuration. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Results indicated an increase in weight-at-age between 1986-1989. Thereafter, weight-at-age and fish condition declined in all parts of the Baltic proper. The decreases were evident in 0 through to 8 year old fish. Moreover, the declines were larger in the northern (51{\%}) than in the south-western (42{\%}) part of the Baltic proper and for younger (1-4 years) fish compared to the older fish (5-8 years). Possible causes of the decrease in weight-at-age and condition are discussed.

A few studies suggest that the oil spill was toxic to some phytoplankton species, whereas others indicate that the degree of tolerance to the oil or to dispersants differs among species.

In the Baltic Sea, cyanobacteria regularly occur in the late summer months and form nuisance accumulations in surface waters and their abundance has intensified significantly in the past 50 years attributed to human-induced eutrophication. However, the natural occurrence of cyanobacteria during the Holocene is debated. In this study, we present records of cyanobacteria pigments, water column redox proxies, and nitrogen isotopic signatures for the past ca. 8000 years from Baltic Sea sediment cores. Our results demonstrate that cyanobacteria abundance and nitrogen fixation are correlated with hypoxia occurring during three main intervals: (1) ca. 7000-4000 B.P. during the Littorina transgression, (2) ca. 1400-700 B.P. during the Medieval Climate Anomaly, and (3) from ca. 1950 A.D. to the present. Issues of preservation were investigated, and we show that organic matter and pigment profiles are not simply an artifact of preservation. These results suggest that cyanobacteria abundance is sustained during periods of hypoxia, most likely because of enhanced recycling of phosphorus in low oxygen conditions. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

Observations show that the mean weight of central Baltic Sea herring (Clupea harengus), a quantity unbiased by fisheries, is indirectly influenced by the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) via a complex mediator chain, in which a transition from a marine to a freshwater state plays a major role. This observed trend is also projected for the future in regional climate change scenarios. The consequence of increasing precipitation is a reduction in the marine habitat, a change in the prey community and a decrease in the mean weight of three-year-old central Baltic Sea herring from 50-70 g in the late 1970s to 25-30 g today. The reduction in weight over this period represents a reduction in landings of approximately one million tons of herring and an economic loss of the order of €100 million.},

A pre-core indicator is the diatom/dinoflagellate index (Dia/Dino index), which reflects the dominance of diatoms or dinoflagellates during the phytoplankton spring bloom. Here we explain the principles of the Dia/Dino index and the conditions for its calculation using examples from two very different water bodies, the Eastern Gotland Basin and Kiel Bay. The index is based on seasonal mean diatom and dinoflagellate biomass values. A precondition for its applicability is the coverage of the bloom. As a criterion, the maximum value of diatom or dinoflagellate biomass has to exceed a predefined threshold, e.g., 1000 $\mu$g/L in the investigated areas. If this condition is not fulfilled, an alternative Dia/Dino index can be calculated based on silicate consumption data. Changes in the dominance of these two phytoplankton classes impact the food web because both their quality as a food source for grazers and their periods of occurrence differ. If diatoms are dominant, their rapid sinking reduces the food stock for zooplankton but delivers plenty of food to the zoobenthos. Consequently, the Dia/Dino index can be used to follow the food pathway (Descriptor 4 of MSFD: "food web"). Moreover, a low Dia/Dino index may indicate silicate limitation caused by eutrophication (Descriptor 5 of MSFD: "eutrophication"). The Dia/Dino index was able to identify the regime shift that occurred at the end of the 1980s in the Baltic Proper. Diatom dominance, and thus a high Dia/Dino index, are typical in historical data and are therefore assumed to reflect good environmental status (GES). In assessments of the environmental status of the Eastern Gotland Basin and Kiel Bay, Dia/Dino index GES thresholds of 0.5 and 0.75, respectively, are suggested. The GES thresholds as calculated by the alternative Dia/Dino index are 0.84 and 0.94, respectively.},

abstract = {In temperate systems, phytoplankton spring blooms deplete inorganic nutrients and are major sources of organic matter for the microbial loop. In response to phytoplankton exudates and environmental factors, heterotrophic microbial communities are highly dynamic and change their abundance and composition both on spatial and temporal scales. Yet, most of our understanding about these processes comes from laboratory model organism studies, mesocosm experiments or single temporal transects. Spatial-temporal studies examining interactions of phytoplankton blooms and bacterioplankton community composition and function, though being highly informative, are scarce. In this study, pelagic microbial community dynamics (bacteria and phytoplankton) and environmental variables were monitored during a spring bloom across the Baltic Proper (two cruises between North Germany to Gulf of Finland). To test to what extent bacterioplankton community composition relates to the spring bloom, we used next generation amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, phytoplankton diversity analysis based on microscopy counts and population genotyping of the dominating diatom Skeletonema marinoi. Several phytoplankton bloom related and environmental variables were identified to influence bacterial community composition. Members of Bacteroidetes and Alphaproteobacteria dominated the bacterial community composition but the bacterial groups showed no apparent correlation with direct bloom related variables. The less abundant bacterial phyla Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia, on the other hand, were strongly associated with phytoplankton biomass, diatom:dinoflagellate ratio, and colored dissolved organic matter (cDOM). Many bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showed high niche specificities. For example, particular Bacteroidetes OTUs were associated with two distinct genetic clusters of S. marinoi. Our study revealed the complexity of interactions of bacterial taxa with inter- and intraspecific genetic variation in phytoplankton. Overall, our findings imply that biotic and abiotic factors during spring bloom influence bacterial community dynamics in a hierarchical manner.},

abstract = {The Baltic Sea is affected by a range of human induced environmental pressures such as eutrophication. Here we synthesize the ongoing shift from diatom dominance toward more dinoflagellates in parts of the Baltic Sea during the spring bloom and its potential effects on biogeochemical cycling of key elements (e.g., C, N, and P). The spring bloom is the period with the highest annual primary production and sinking of organic matter to the sediment. The fate of this organic matter is a key driver for material fluxes, affecting ecosystem functioning and eutrophication feedback loops. The dominant diatoms and dinoflagellates appear to be functionally surrogates as both groups are able to effectively exhaust the wintertime accumulation of inorganic nutrients and produce bloom level biomass that contribute to vertical export of organic matter. However, the groups have very different sedimentation patterns, and the seafloor has variable potential to mineralize the settled biomass in the different sub-basins. While diatoms sink quickly out of the euphotic zone, dinoflagellates sink as inert resting cysts, or lyse in the water column contributing to slowly settling phyto-detritus. The dominance by either phytoplankton group thus directly affects both the summertime nutrient pools of the water column and the input of organic matter to the sediment but to contrasting directions. The proliferation of dinoflagellates with high encystment efficiency could increase sediment retention and burial of organic matter, alleviating the eutrophication problem and improve the environmental status of the Baltic Sea.},

The effect of salinity (0 to 34 psu) on egg hatching success was also examined. The highest mean rates of EP were observed between 22 and 23°C (46.8-50.9 eggs female-1 day-1). When studied at 18 psu, hatching success of eggs increased with increasing temperature and was highest (92.2{\%}) at 23°C. No hatching was observed for eggs incubated at low temperatures (≤ 12°C) that were produced by females acclimated to temperatures ≤ 10°C indicating a possible thermal threshold between 10.0 and 13.0°C below which only the production of diapause (or low quality) eggs exists in this population. When tested at 18°C, the hatching success of eggs incubated at 15 different salinities increased asymptotically with increasing salinity and was maximal (81.4-84.5{\%}) between 17 and 25 psu. The high reproductive success observed over wide ranges in temperatures and salinities in this Baltic population demonstrates one of the mechanisms responsible for the cosmopolitan distribution of this species within productive, estuarine and marine habitats. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

Long time-series of population dynamics are increasingly needed in order to understand human impacts on marine ecosystems and support their sustainable management. In this study, the estimates of sprat (Sprattus sprattus balticus) biomass in the Baltic Sea were extended back from the beginning of ICES stock assessments in 1974 to the early 1900s. The analyses identified peaks in sprat spawner biomass in the beginning of the 1930s, 1960s, and 1970s at ∼900 kt. Only a half of that biomass was estimated for the late 1930s, for the period from the late 1940s to the mid-1950s, and for the mid-1960s. For the 1900s, fisheries landings suggest a relatively high biomass, similar to the early 1930s. The exploitation rate of sprat was low until the development of pelagic fisheries in the 1960s. Spatially resolved analyses from the 1960s onwards demonstrate changes in the distribution of sprat biomass over time. The average body weight of sprat by age in the 1950s to 1970s was higher than at present, but lower than during the 1980s to 1990s. The results of this study facilitate new analyses of the effects of climate, predation, and anthropogenic drivers on sprat, and contribute to setting long-term management strategies for the Baltic Sea.},

abstract = {At specific locations within the Baltic Sea, thermoclines and haloclines can create rapid spatial and temporal changes in temperature (T) and salinity (S) exceeding 10°C and 9 psu with seasonal ranges in temperature exceeding 20°C. These wide ranges in abiotic factors affect the distribution and abundance of Baltic Sea copepods via species-specific, physiological-based impacts on vital rates. In this laboratory study, we characterized the influence of T and S on aspects of reproductive success and naupliar survival of a southwestern Baltic population of Temora longicornis (Copepoda: Calanoida). First, using ad libitum feeding conditions, we measured egg production (EP, no. of eggs female-1 day-1) at 12 different temperatures between 2.5 and 24°C, observing the highest mean EP at 16.9°C (12 eggs female-1 day-1). Next, the effect of S on EP and hatching success (HS, {\%}) was quantified at 12°C for cohorts that had been acclimated to either 8, 14, 20 or 26 psu and tested at each of five salinities (8, 14, 20, 26 and 32 psu). The mean EP was highest for (and maximum EP similar among) 14, 20 and 26 psu cohorts when tested at their acclimation salinity whereas EP was lower at other salinities. For adults reared at 8 psu, a commonly encountered salinity in Baltic surface waters, EP was relatively low at all test salinities-a pattern indicative of osmotic stress. When incubated at 12°C and 15 different salinities between 0 and 34 psu, HS increased asymptotically with increasing S and was maximal (82.6-84.3{\%}) between 24 and 26 psu. However, HS did depend upon the adult acclimation salinity. Finally, the 48-h survival of nauplii hatched and reared at 14 psu at one of six different temperatures (10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20°C) was measured after exposure to a novel salinity (either 7 or 20 psu). Upon exposure to 7 psu, 48-h naupliar mortality increased with increasing temperature, ranging from 26.7{\%} at 10°C to 63.2{\%} at 20°C. In contrast, after exposure to 20 psu, mortality was relatively low at all temperatures (1.7{\%} at 10°C and =26.7{\%} for all other temperatures). An intra-specific comparison of EP for three different T. longicornis populations revealed markedly different temperature optima and clearly demonstrated the negative impact of brackish (Baltic) salinities. Our results provide estimates of reproductive success and early survival of T. longicornis to the wide ranges of temperatures and salinities that will aid ongoing biophysical modeling examining climate impacts on this species within the Baltic Sea. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The Baltic Sea ecosystem has undergone large changes during the last two decades, including a severe reduction in cod and herring biomass but, at the same time, a large increase in sprat abundance. The lower trophic levels of the Baltic Sea also changed due to environmental fluctuations, including variations in salinity and in volume of oxygenated water. In this apparently shifting environment, the conditions of herring and sprat have undergone large inter-annual variations during the past 15-20 years. In this study, we explore how abiotic factors (i.e. salinity and temperature) and biotic factors (biomass of the copepods Pseudocalanus elongatus, Temora longicornis, Acartia spp. and of cladocerans as well as clupeid abundance) in different seasons (May and August) affect clupeid body condition. Our analyses suggest that data of zooplankton biomass and abiotic factors in August have higher predictive power than May data. Although our analysis suggests that salinity (a bottom-up process) has an effect on sprat condition, total abundance of clupeids (a top-down process) is by far the most significant predictor of both herring and sprat condition. The strong correlation between clupeid abundance and total zooplankton biomass points to food competition and to top-down control by herring and sprat on common food resources. Furthermore, clupeid condition co-varied with the changes in the weight of zooplankton in the stomachs, which further suggest food competition being the main mechanism behind the changes in clupeid condition during the last two decades. Hence, our results are not in agreement with most of the current literature that has suggested that clupeid growth is regulated by environmentally mediated bottom-up processes acting on the abundance of copepods. This is, to our knowledge, the first evidence of food resources mediated density-dependent fish growth in a large marine ecosystem. Copyright {\textcopyright} Oikos 2006.},

abstract = {The algal spring bloom in the Baltic Sea represents an anomaly from the winter-spring bloom patterns worldwide in terms of frequent and recurring dominance of dinoflagellates over diatoms. Analysis of approximately 3500 spring bloom samples from the Baltic Sea monitoring programs revealed (i) that within the major basins the proportion of dinoflagellates varied from 0.1 (Kattegat) to {\textgreater}0.8 (central Baltic Proper), and (ii) substantial shifts (e.g. from 0.2 to 0.6 in the Gulf of Finland) in the dinoflagellate proportion over four decades. During a recent decade (1995-2004) the proportion of dinoflagellates increased relative to diatoms mostly in the northernmost basins (Gulf of Bothnia, from 0.1 to 0.4) and in the Gulf of Finland, (0.4 to 0.6) which are typically ice-covered areas. We hypothesize that in coastal areas a specific sequence of seasonal events, involving wintertime mixing and resuspension of benthic cysts, followed by proliferation in stratified thin layers under melting ice, favors successful seeding and accumulation of dense dinoflagellate populations over diatoms. This head-start of dinoflagellates by the onset of the spring bloom is decisive for successful competition with the faster growing diatoms. Massive cyst formation and spreading of cyst beds fuel the expanding and ever larger dinoflagellate blooms in the relatively shallow coastal waters. Shifts in the dominant spring bloom algal groups can have significant effects on major elemental fluxes and functioning of the Baltic Sea ecosystem, but also in the vast shelves and estuaries at high latitudes, where ice-associated cold-water dinoflagellates successfully compete with diatoms. {\textcopyright} 2011 Klais et al.},

The estimation of the intensity of hazard and the vulnerability of buildings to windstorms are important parts of a windstorm risk assessment model. The vulnerability functions (or curves) are, in general, based on analyses of loss data from insurance companies. The loss data available from insurance companies following a natural disaster is generally comprised of losses representative of a wide variety of buildings, often lacking information on building-specific characteristics such as height and material. Analysis of such data may not go beyond the development of an aggregate (or generic) vulnerability curve for a combined portfolio giving no idea of the vulnerability of individual building types represented by this curve. The paper discusses the vulnerability of buildings to windstorms and the development of vulnerability functions for windstorm loss estimation. A methodology is presented for the disaggregation of a generic vulnerability curve into several curves representing individual building types. The methodology provides a convenient way of translating known vulnerabilities for a region to those for another region by combining them with actuarial data and building inventory information of the region. The methodology is applied for the disaggregation of generic vulnerability curves for the Caribbean Island of Puerto Rico. The hurricane hazards and the consequent property losses in the region are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {On October 26, 2015, IARC published a summary of their findings regarding the association of cancer with consumption of red meat or processed meat (IARC 2015; The Lancet Oncology 2015). The Working Group concluded that there is limited evidence in human beings for carcinogenicity from the consumption of red meat and inadequate evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of consumption of red meat. Nevertheless, the working group concluded that there is strong mechanistic evidence by which ingestion of red meat can be linked to human colorectal cancer and assigned red meat to Group 2A “probably carcinogenic to humans”. The Working Group cited supporting mechanistic evidence for multiple meat components, including those formed from meat processing, such as N-nitroso compounds (NOC) and heterocyclic aromatic amines, and the endogenous compound, heme iron. The mechanism of action for each of these components is different and so it is critical to evaluate the evidence for each component separately. Consequently, this review critically examined studies that investigated mechanistic evidence associated with heme iron to assess the weight of the evidence associating exposure to red meat with colorectal cancer. The evidence from in vitro studies utilized conditions that are not necessarily relevant for a normal dietary intake and thus do not provide sufficient evidence that heme exposure from typical red meat consumption would increase the risk of colon cancer. Animal studies utilized models that tested promotion of preneoplastic conditions utilizing diets low in calcium, high in fat combined with exaggerations of heme exposure that in many instances represented intakes that were orders of magnitude above normal dietary consumption of red meat. Finally, clinical evidence suggests that the type of NOC found after ingestion of red meat in humans consists mainly of nitrosyl iron and nitrosothiols, products that have profoundly different chemistries from certain N-nitroso species which have been shown to be tumorigenic through the formation of DNA adducts. In conclusion, the methodologies employed in current studies of heme have not provided sufficient documentation that the mechanisms studied would contribute to an increased risk of promotion of preneoplasia or colon cancer at usual dietary intakes of red meat in the context of a normal diet.},

The aim of this paper was to compile existing methods to assess dietary risk and identify their limitations in terms of lifetime risk assessment. To this end, we reviewed the different methods currently used at each step of risk assessment (i.e. methods to collect consumption data, to compute dietary exposures, and then to interpret these exposures in terms of risk for the consumer). Numerous methodologies exist to collect consumption data, contamination data collection, as well as for data treatment and interpretation. These methods consider different hypotheses and therefore lead to numerous uncertainties and discrepancies in the estimation of the exposure. Moreover, changes in eating habits through life, evolutions of food contamination, as well as health risk induced by fluctuating exposures, are rarely studied. A scientific consensus on the current risk assessment approaches is needed between national regulatory authorities. Moreover, additional research activities appear needed to take the evolution of consumption and contamination through time into account and to be able to assess the dietary health risk over the entire life.},

abstract = {with support (Sec. III.) from Keith Compton, IIASA Decision 5/CP.7 calls for the implementation of two insurance-related workshops. This paper focuses on the needs of developing countries arising from the impacts of climate change, in particular extreme weather events. It is intended to provide background material for participants attending the workshops and for work on insurance-related activities in the UNFCCC context. This paper contains information on the legal context of insurance-related actions within the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol (Section I), describes the challenge of risk assessment and sharing of the risks of extreme weather events in developing countries (Section II), and presents an overview of risk assessment methodology and the difficulties arising when climate change concerns are incorporated in risk assessment and modeling (Section III). Section IV then presents examples of catastrophe insurance and other risk hedging instruments that have developed, as national and international institutions have increasingly sought out private-public partnerships to assist in the transfer of risk related to natural disasters. Section V presents further examples of how insurance concepts have been utilized by the international community in the establishment of sophisticated legal mechanisms for risk-transfer for transboundary environmental damage, noting the ways in which compulsory private insurance and collective loss sharing arrangements have emerged as preferred risk transfer strategies within those mechanisms. Finally, Section VI presents some issues for discussion as well as options for cooperation of the climate regime with other existing institutions engaged in related substantive work.},

abstract = {The increasing use of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in nano-enabled products (NEPs) has raised societal concerns about their possible health and ecological implications. To ensure a high level of human and environmental protection it is essential to properly estimate the risks of these new materials and to develop adequate risk management strategies. To this end, we propose a quantitative Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) methodology, which was developed in the European Seventh Framework research project SUN (Sustainable Nanotechnologies) and implemented in the web-based SUN Decision Support System (SUNDS). One of the major strengths of this probabilistic approach as compared to its deterministic alternatives is its ability to clearly communicate the uncertainties in the estimated risks in order to support better risk communication for more objective decision making by industries and regulators. To demonstrate this methodology, we applied it in a real case study involving a nanoscale organic red pigment used in the automotive industry. Our analysis clearly showed that the main source of uncertainty was the extrapolation from (sub)acute in vivo toxicity data to long-term risk. This extrapolation was necessary due to a lack of (sub)chronic in vivo studies for the investigated nanomaterial. Despite the high uncertainty in the final results due to the conservative assumptions made in the risks assessment, the estimated risks are acceptable for all investigated exposure scenarios along the product lifecycle.},

abstract = {“Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage” was established in 2013 and further supported through the Paris Agreement in 2015. Despite advances, the debate currently is broad, diffuse and somewhat confusing, while concepts, meth- ods and tools, as well as directions for policy remain vague and often contested. This book, a joint effort of the Loss and Damage Network—a partnership effort by scientists and practitioners from around the globe—provides evidence-based insight into the L{\&}D discourse by highlighting state-of-the-art research conducted across multiple disciplines, by showcasing applications in practice and by providing insight into policy contexts and salient policy options.This introductory chapter summarises key findings of the twenty-two book chapters in terms of five propositions. These propositions, each building on relevant findings linked to forward-looking sugges- tions for research, policy and practice, reflect the architecture of the book, whose sections proceed from setting the stage to critical issues, followed by a section on methods and tools, to chapters that provide geographic perspectives, and finally to a section that identifies potential policy options. The propositions comprise (1) Risk management can be an effective entry point for aligning perspectives and debates, if framed comprehensively, coupled with climate justice considerations and linked to established risk management and adaptation practice; (2) Attribution science is advancing rapidly and fundamental to informing actions to minimise, avert, and address losses and damages; (3) Climate change research, in addition to identifying physical/hard limits to adaptation, needs to more systematically examine soft limits to adaptation, for which we find some evidence across several geographies globally; (4) Climate risk insurance mechanisms can serve the prevention and cure aspects emphasised in the L{\&}Ddebate but solidarity and accountability aspects need further attention, forwhich we find tentative indication in applications around theworld; (5) Policy deliberations may need to overcome the perception that L{\&}D constitutes a win-lose negotiation “game” by developing amore inclusive narrative that highlights collective ambition for tackling risks,mutual benefits and the role of transformation.},

@article{Tett2013,
abstract = {ABSTRACT: Although the terms 'health' and 'healthy' are often applied to marine ecosystems and communicate information about holistic condition (e.g. as required by the Ecosystem Approach), their meaning is unclear. Ecosystems have been understood in various ways, from non-interacting populations of species to complex integrated systems. Health has been seen as a metaphor, an indicator that aggregates over system components, or a non-localized emergent system property. After a review, we define good ecosystem health as: 'the condition of a system that is self-maintaining, vigorous, resilient to externally imposed pressures, and able to sustain services to humans. It contains healthy organisms and populations, and adequate functional diversity and functional response diversity. All expected trophic levels are present and well interconnected, and there is good spatial connectivity amongst subsystems.' We equate this condition with good ecological or environmental status, e.g. as referred to by recent EU Directives. Resilience is central to health, but difficult to measure directly. Ecosystems under anthropogenic pressure are at risk of losing resilience, and thus of suffering regime shifts and loss of services. For monitoring whole ecosystems, we propose an approach based on 'trajectories in ecosystem state space', illustrated with time-series from the northwestern North Sea. Change is visualized as Euclidian distance from an arbitrary reference state. Variability about a trend in distance is used as a proxy for inverse resilience. We identify the need for institutional support for long time-series to underpin this approach, and for research to establish state space co-ordinates for systems in good health. Changes in the northern North Sea, 1958-2008, plotted in a state space defined by the breeding success of kittiwakes, abundance of copepods Calanus spp., and simulated annual primary production.{\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2013. www.int-res.com.},

For each of the two driving global models HadAM3H and ECHAM4/OPYC3, one control run (1961-1990) and two scenario runs (2071-2100) based upon the SRES A2 and B2 emission scenarios were conducted. The future sea-ice volume in the Baltic Sea is reduced by 83{\%} on average. The Bothnian Sea, large areas of the Gulf of Finland and Gulf of Riga, and the outer parts of the southwestern archipelago of Finland will become ice-free in the mean. The presented scenarios are used to study the impact of climate change on the Baltic ringed seal (Phoca hispida botnica). Climate change seems to be a major threat to all southern populations. The only fairly good winter sea-ice habitat is found to be confined to the Bay of Bothnia.},

abstract = {Substantial ecological changes occurred in the 1970s in the Northern Baltic during a temporary period of low salinity (S). This period was preceded by an episodic increase in the rainfall over the Baltic Sea watershed area. Several climate models, both global and regional, project an increase in the runoff of the Northern latitudes due to proceeding climate change. The aim of this study is to model, firstly, the effects on Baltic Sea salinity of increased runoff due to projected global change and, secondly, the effects of salinity change on the distribution of marine species. The results suggest a critical shift in the S range 5-7, which is a threshold for both freshwater and marine species distributions and diversity. We discuss several topics emphasizing future monitoring, modelling, and fisheries research. Environmental monitoring and modelling are investigated because the developing alternative ecosystems do not necessarily show the same relations to environment quality factors as the retiring ones. An important corollary is that the observed and modelled S changes considered together with species' ranges indicate what may appear under a future climate. Consequences could include a shift in distribution areas of marine benthic foundation species and some 40-50 other species, affiliated to these. This change would extend over hundreds of kilometres, in the Baltic Sea and the adjacent North Sea areas. Potential cascading effects, in coastal ecology, fish ecology and fisheries would be extensive, and point out the necessity to develop further the "ecosystem approach in the environmental monitoring".},

abstract = {Processes controlling the production of new fish (recruitment) are poorly understood and therefore challenge population ecologists and resource managers. Sprat in the Baltic Sea is no exception: recruitment varies widely between years and is virtually independent of the biomass of mature sprat. Sprat is a key prey and predator species in the Baltic ecosystem and is commercially exploited (1.86 × 108 kg/yr since 1974). The population and fishery must therefore be managed sustainably and if necessary accommodate environmental effects on population dynamics. We demonstrate using 45 years of data that recruitment depends on temperature conditions during the months when sprat gonads, eggs, and larvae are developing. We also show that recruitment can be predicted before adults spawn (and fully 15 months earlier than using present technology) by using linkages between recruitment, large-scale climate variability (North Atlantic Oscillation), Baltic Sea ice coverage, and water temperature. These relationships increase our understanding of sprat population dynamics and enable a desirable integration of fisheries ecology and management with climatology and oceanography.},

Applying various nutrient load scenarios we show that under the impact of warming climate hypoxic and anoxic areas will very likely increase or at best only slightly decrease (in case of optimistic nutrient load reductions) compared to present conditions, regardless of the used global model and climate scenario. The projected decreased oxygen concentrations are caused by (1) enlarged nutrient loads due to increased runoff, (2) reduced oxygen flux from the atmosphere to the ocean due to increased temperature, and (3) intensified internal nutrient cycling. In future climate a similar expansion of hypoxia as projected for the Baltic Sea can be expected also for other coastal oceans worldwide. Copyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {The phytoplankton biomass data of the period 1979-2005 of the Belt Sea area and the Baltic Proper, separated into spring, summer and autumn data, were checked for trends, together with the relevant abiotic factors (temperature, salinity, and nutrient concentrations). The Mann-Kendall test was used for detecting monotonic trends over the whole investigation period or, if trend breaks occurred, over the period before and after the trend breaks. The relationships between phytoplankton community composition and the environmental variables were assessed by a redundancy analysis (RDA), which could support some results of the trend analyses. Water temperature increased but salinity and inorganic nitrogen concentrations decreased in the southern Baltic Proper. Spring phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll a concentrations increased in the Baltic Proper and decreased in Mecklenburg Bight. The biomass of Diatomophyceae decreased in spring at some stations but increased in autumn. If the Diatomophyceae spring blooms decreased, the total Dinophyceae biomass increased. Strong spring blooms of Diatomophyceae occurred in the 1980s and since 2000, but those of Dinophyceae in the 1990s. These two groups showed alternating oscillations.

Using projections of future North Sea surface temperatures for the period 2000-2050 from the Hadley General Circulation Model, we estimate the likely effects of climate change on the North Sea cod population. Output from the model suggests that increasing temperatures will lead to an increased rate of decline in the North Sea cod population compared with simulations that ignore environmental change. Although the simulation developed here is relatively simplistic, we demonstrate that inclusion of environmental factors in population models can markedly alter one's perception of how the population will behave. The development of simulations incorporating environment effects will become increasingly important as the impacts of climate change on the marine ecosystem become more pronounced.},

abstract = {The grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) population in the Baltic Sea is recovering after a century of bounty hunting and 3 decades of low fertility rates caused by environmental pollution. A conservative estimate of the population size in 2003 was 19,400 animals, and available data suggest an annual rate of increase of 7.5{\%} since 1990. The growing population has led to increased interactions with the fishery, and demands are being raised for the re-introduction of the hunt. We provide a demographic analysis and a risk assessment of the population, and make recommendations on how to decrease the risk of over exploitation. Although hunting increases the risk of quasi-extinction, the risk can be significantly reduced by the choice of a cautious hunting regime. The least hazardous regimes allow no hunting below a ‘security level' in population size. Obviously, to implement such a hunting regime detailed knowledge of the population size and growth rate is required. It is not possible to estimate “true” risks for quasi-extinction, but we used an approach where the relative difference for different scenarios can be compared. With a security level at 5,000 females, the population quasi-extinction risk increases 50 fold at an annual hunt of 500 females compared with a scenario with no hunting. The risk of quasi-extinction is very sensitive to declines in the mean growth rate and to increased variance in growth rate. The variance in the population estimates over the last 14 years imply that it would take 9 years to detect a declinefrom 1.075 to 1.027 in the rate of population increase. We also show how the age composition of killed animals influences the impact of the hunt. The overall recommendation is that hunting should be kept to a minimum, carefully documented and accompanied by close population monitoring.},

The processes responsible for the formation of the surface and bottom phosphate pools in winter, the exchange processes between the pools and the amount of phosphate transported from the bottom pool to the surface are not fully understood. We did not find any significant correlation between the wintertime bottom layer (BL) DIP and upper mixed layer (UML) DIP for the deeper Baltic Sea sub-basins. Instead, we found a significant correlation between UML DIP and UMLD in winter. With the present considerable trend of decrease of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration (DIN) in the Baltic Proper (BP) it is mainly the DIP variability determines the excess phosphate, and which is regarded as the main phosphate source for the late summer cyanobacterial blooms in the Baltic Sea. This conclusion is confirmed by the observed coherent behaviour of the satellite-derived mean Chl a concentration data in July (here considered as a proxy of the summertime cyanobacteria biomass concentration) and eDIP in the open Baltic Proper. Relying on the established here correlation between the July's mean Chl a concentration and the direct cyanobacteria biomass measurements in the Gulf of Finland, our study supports the following cause and effect chain: wintertime deep mixing → high wintertime eDIP → (potentially) strong cyanobacterial bloom in (late) summer. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Precipitation may increase {\~{}}30 {\%} in the north, causing increased land runoff of allochthonous organic matter (AOM) and organic pollutants and decreased salinity.

In the north, heterotrophic bacteria will be favored by AOM, while phytoplankton production may be reduced. Extra trophic levels in the food web may increase energy losses and consequently reduce fish production. Future management of the Baltic Sea must consider the effects of climate change on the ecosystem dynamics and functions, as well as the effects of anthropogenic nutrient and pollutant load. Monitoring should have a holistic approach, encompassing both autotrophic (phytoplankton) and heterotrophic (e.g., bacterial) processes.},

abstract = {Predicting the response of the biota to global change remains a formidable endeavor. Zooplankton face challenges related to global warming, ocean acidification, the proliferation of toxic algal blooms, and increasing pollution, eutrophication, and hypoxia. They can respond to these changes by phenotypic plasticity or genetic adaptation. Using the concept of the evolution of reaction norms, I address how adaptive responses can be unequivocally discerned from phenotypic plasticity. To date, relatively few zooplankton studies have been designed for such a purpose. As case studies, I review the evidence for zooplankton adaptation to toxic algal blooms, hypoxia, and climate change. Predicting the response of zooplankton to global change requires new information to determine (a) the trade-offs and costs of adaptation, (b) the rates of evolution versus environmental change, (c) the consequences of adaptation to stochastic or cyclic (toxic algal blooms, coastal hypoxia) versus directional (temperature, acidification, open ocean hypoxia) environmental change, and (d) the interaction of selective pressures, and evolutionary and ecological processes, in promoting or hindering adaptation. {\textcopyright} 2013 by Annual Reviews.

abstract = {Information on physiological rates and tolerances helps one gain a cause-and-effect understanding of the role that some environmental (bottom-up) factors play in regulating the seasonality and productivity of key species. We combined the results of laboratory experiments on reproductive success and field time series data on adult abundance to explore factors controlling the seasonality of Acartia spp., Eurytemora affinis and Temora longicornis, key copepods of brackish, coastal and temperate environments. Patterns in laboratory and field data were discussed using a metabolic framework that included the effects of 'controlling', 'masking' and 'directive' environmental factors. Over a 5-year period, changes in adult abundance within two south-west Baltic field sites (Kiel Fjord Pier, 54°19′89N, 10°09′06E, 12-21 psu, and North/Baltic Sea Canal NOK, 54°20′45N, 9°57′02E, 4-10 psu) were evaluated with respect to changes in temperature, salinity, day length and chlorophyll a concentration. Acartia spp. dominated the copepod assemblage at both sites (up to 16,764 and 21,771 females m -3 at NOK and Pier) and was 4 to 10 times more abundant than E. affinis (to 2,939 m -3 at NOK) and T. longicornis (to 1,959 m -3 at Pier), respectively. Species-specific salinity tolerance explains differences in adult abundance between sampling sites whereas phenological differences among species are best explained by the influence of species-specific thermal windows and prey requirements supporting survival and egg production. Multiple intrinsic and extrinsic (environmental) factors influence the production of different egg types (normal and resting), regulate life-history strategies and influence match-mismatch dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Practical and applied knowledge of local fishers can help to improve our understanding of target species ecology and fisheries management decisions. In the Western Baltic Sea (WBS), the spatio-temporal distribution of cod is still largely unknown despite decades of research. We studied changes in cod distribution by obtaining information on temporal depth and habitat use of cod from commercial gillnet fishers using semi-directed interviews supplemented by at-sea observer data. Linear and non-linear regression analyses revealed significant relationships between depth use of cod and sea surface temperature (SST) as well as thermal stratification. Moreover, habitat use was related to SST and residence depth of cod. Areas deeper than 15 m were favoured from late December until March during low SST and a mixed water column (spawning) and also from July until August during high SST and strong thermal stratification (summer aestivation). Shallower areas were favoured during the rest of the year. The depth and habitat use displayed distinct seasonal up- and downslope movements of cod. This study highlights the importance of shallow-water and structured habitats for cod in the WBS and the value of local knowledge held by fishers for a better understanding of the distributional dynamics of important marine resource populations.},

abstract = {The aim of our study was the exploration of species-specific distribution and production patterns of dominant copepods in the Central Baltic Sea (Bornholm Basin). Spatio-temporal distribution, egg and secondary production were studied by means of net-sampling and egg production experiments from April to August 1999. Vertical and horizontal distribution patterns appeared to be linked with each other and were primarily species-dependent. Both Acartia spp. and Temora longicornis preferentially inhabited the upper 30 m of the water column and the shallower marginal regions of the Bornholm Basin. In contrast, the C4-5 and C6 of Pseudocalanus spp. preferentially inhabited the halocline region (50-70 m) and the deep central part of the area. Observed differences in horizontal distribution among these three copepods appear to result from different depth preferences and depth-dependent water circulation patterns. Egg production rates (EPR) clearly exhibited seasonal differences with maximum EPR in May and minimum EPR in July. Mean EPR was significantly different between species, being highest in Acartia spp. and lowest in Pseudocalanus spp. The variability in EPR was related to differences in hydrography and modelled food environment. {\textcopyright} The Author 2005.

abstract = {H{\"{u}}ssy, K. 2011. Review of western Baltic cod (Gadus morhua) recruitment dynamics. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: 1459–1471. Important processes in the recruitment dynamics of western Baltic cod (Gadus morhua) are identified. Spawning areas are in the deep, saline waters below 20–40 m, depending on area topography. Spatial distribution remains relatively stable over time. Peak spawning shows an area-specific pattern, with progressively later spawning towards the east. Genetic stock structure and tagging indicate some degree of natal homing for spawning. The highly variable hydrodynamic conditions and the fact that cod eggs float in the water column cause their entrainment by currents, and their destination is determined by the prevailing winds and currents. Drift is almost exclusively to the east, but the magnitude and its impact on the structure of the affected stocks (Kattegat, western Baltic, and eastern Baltic) remains unresolved. Salinity limits the east–west exchange of eggs as a consequence of the stocks' differential requirement for neutral buoyancy. Superimposed on this, oxygen content and temperature have a significant effect on fertilization, egg/larva development, and survival. Within the Baltic Sea ecosystem, mixing of stocks may be anticipated and is particularly pronounced in the Arkona Basin because of its use for spawning by both western and eastern stocks, the advection of early life stages from the west and immigration/emigration from the east.},

Hydrographic influence on the spawning habitat suitability of western Baltic cod (Gadus morhua) – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 69: 1736–1743. Recruitment variability of marine fish is influenced by the reproductive potential of the stock (i.e. stock characteristics and abundance) and the survival of early life stages, mediated by environmental conditions of both a physical (water temperature, salinity and oxygen conditions, ocean currents) and a biological nature (i.e. food, predators). The objective of this study is to assess the importance of variability in environmental conditions within different western Baltic cod spawning grounds for egg survival. Habitat identification was based on environmental threshold levels for egg survival and development and ambient hydrographical conditions at different times during the spawning season. The long-term resolution of environmental conditions allowing survival of western Baltic cod eggs indicates that favourable conditions predominantly occurred during the late spawning season in April/May, while minimum survival rates could be expected from January to March. Unsuitable time periods and habitats exhibiting the highest mortality rates are exclusively characterized by ambient water temperatures below the critical survival threshold. Despite the strong influence of water temperature on habitat suitability, the impact of habitat suitability on recruitment was not clearly defined, suggesting that other mechanisms regulate year class strength.},

abstract = {We studied the physiological response of Pseudocalanus sp. under four different temperature elevation regimes: +0, +2, +4 and +6°C above the decadal average temperature in the Western Baltic Sea. We measured fecal pellet (FP) production rates, which was taken as a proxy of ingestion, egg production (EPR) and respiration rates. Experiments lasted from mid-February to end April, corresponding most of the observations to the postspring bloom phase. We combined small scale incubations with the use of big (ca. 1400L) mesocosms, which have previously been shown to be appropriate when studying phyto- and zooplankton succession, and the water used for the incubations was taken from the mesocosm tanks. Given that the phytoplankton succession varied between the four thermal scenarios, we evaluated (excepting in the case of the respiration rates, where incubations were carried out using 0.2 $\mu$m filtered water) both the temperature and the associated food concentration effects. Respiration and ingestion rates were found to increase with temperature. As for EPR, they also increased with temperature during the bloom, but remained at low and constant values during the postbloom in all the four treatments due to the food limitation. Linked to the temperature rise, we also detected an increase in instantaneous mortality rates and a reduction in the net growth efficiency. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of our findings for the spring phyto- and zooplankton succession under the forecasted climate warming, as well as for the fisheries in the Baltic Sea, where Pseudocalanus sp. is a key species. {\textcopyright} Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing.},

abstract = {To understand the effects of predicted warming and changing salinity of marine ecosystems, it is important to have a good knowledge of species vulnerability and their capacity to adapt to environmental changes. In spring and autumn of 2014, we conducted common garden experiments to investigate how different populations of the copepod Eurytemora affinis from the Baltic Sea respond to varying temperatures and salinity conditions. Copepods were collected in the Stockholm archipelago, Bothnian Bay, and Gulf of Riga (latitude, longitude: 58°48.19′, 17°37.52′; 65°10.14′, 23°14.41′; 58°21.67′, 24°30.83′). Using individuals with known family structure, we investigated within population variation of the reaction norm (genotype and salinity interaction) as a means to measure adaptive capacity. Our main finding was that low salinity has a detrimental effect on development time, the additive effects of high temperature and low salinity have a negative effect on survival, and their interaction has a negative effect on hatching success. We observed no variation in survival and development within populations, and all genotypes had similar reaction norms with higher survival and faster development in higher salinities. This suggests that there is no single genotype that performs better in low salinity or high salinity; instead, the best genotype in any given salinity is best in all salinities. Genotypes with fast development time also had higher survival compared to slow developing genotypes at all salinities. Our results suggest that E. affinis can tolerate close to freshwater conditions also in high temperatures, but with a significant reduction in fitness.},

abstract = {In the brackish Baltic Sea situated in the transition zone between the Atlantic and Euro-Asiatic continental climate systems, the periods of high abundance of sprat of marine boreal origin coincide with a rich freshwater discharge, large water volume inhabitable by fish, rather high winter temperature and low salinity limiting the stock of its main predator-cod (Gadus morhua callarias). In the freshening periods an additional volume of water with acceptable oxygen and temperature conditions for sprat is formed in the Eastern (E) and, especially, the Northwest (NW) regions of the Baltic Sea. This allows extraordinary increase in sprat abundance/biomass. The conditions for sprat deteriorate during the period of active saline water inflows and colder winters, especially in the NW region. Following the decrease in the volume of water acceptable for the wintering of sprat as to temperature and/or oxygen concentration, some part of the stock may be forced to migrate southwards as in the Southwest (SW) region the conditions are the most stable. This may cause an extensive mixing of the stock components of various regions, hindering the differentiation of sprat regional units in the Baltic Sea. As no isolation of regional spawning concentrations has been found, beginning with 1989 the Baltic sprat has been assessed and managed as one stock unit, despite spatial differences in its morphological characters, growth rate etc. The alternation of periods of different regime-forming conditions (freshening or oceanization) is probably triggered by climate changes. This regularity has been exploited for the composition of long-term forecasts of qualitative changes in fish (incl. sprat) stocks in the Baltic Sea. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Shifts in the distribution patterns of zooplankters in association with these events have been documented, but the mechanisms responsible for these shifts have not been investigated. This study assessed interspecific differences in responses to hypoxia by several species of calanoid copepods common off Turkey Point, Florida. USA: Labidocera aestiva (Wheeler) (a summer/fall species), Acartia tonsa (Dana) (a ubiquitous year-round species), and Centropages hamatus (Lilljeborg) (a winter/spring species). Under conditions of moderate to severe hypoxia 24-h survival experiments were conducted for adults and nauplii of these species from August 1994 to October 1995. Experiments on adults used a flow-through system to maintain constant d.o. concentrations. Adults of A. tonsa showed no decline in survival with d.o. as low as 1.0 ml l-1, sharp declines in survival at d.o. = 0.9 to 0.6 ml l-1, and 100{\%} mortality with d.o. = 0.5 ml l-1. Adults of L. aestiva and C. hamatus were more sensitive to oxygen depletion: both species experienced significant decreases in survival for d.o. = 1.0 ml l-1 Nauplii of L. aestiva and A. tonsa showed no significant mortality with d.o. = 1.1 to 1.5 ml l-1 and d.o. = 0.24 to 0.5 ml l-1, respectively. In addition, experiments investigating behavioral avoid alice of moderate to severe hypoxia were carried out for adults of all three species. None of the three species effectively avoided either severely hypoxic (d.o. {\textless} 0.5 ml l-1) or moderately hypoxic (d.o. = 1.0 ml l-1) bottom layers in stratified columns. These results suggest that in nearshore areas where development of zones of d.o. {\textless} 1.0 ml l-1 may be sudden, widespread, or unpredictable, patterns of reduced copepod abundance in bottom waters may be due primarily to mortality rather than avoidance.},

abstract = {Coral reefs support the livelihood of millions of people especially those engaged in marine fisheries activities. Coral reefs are highly vulnerable to climate change induced stresses that have led to substantial coral mortality over large spatial scales. Such climate change impacts have the potential to lead to declines in marine fish production and compromise the livelihoods of fisheries dependent communities. Yet few studies have examined social vulnerability in the context of changes specific to coral reef ecosystems. In this paper, we examine three dimensions of vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity) of 29 coastal communities across five western Indian Ocean countries to the impacts of coral bleaching on fishery returns. A key contribution is the development of a novel, network-based approach to examining sensitivity to changes in the fishery that incorporates linkages between fishery and non-fishery occupations. We find that key sources of vulnerability differ considerably within and between the five countries. Our approach allows the visualization of how these dimensions of vulnerability differ from site to site, providing important insights into the types of nuanced policy interventions that may help to reduce vulnerability at a specific location. To complement this, we develop framework of policy actions thought to reduce different aspects of vulnerability at varying spatial and temporal scales. Although our results are specific to reef fisheries impacts from coral bleaching, this approach provides a framework for other types of threats and different social-ecological systems more broadly. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Effective ecosystem-based management relies upon synthesizing our scientific knowledge and transferring this knowledge into management actions. Integrated ecosystem assessment is a framework to conduct this scientific synthesis and transfer information to resource managers. Portions of the framework were applied to build consensus on the focal ecosystem components and processes that are characteristic of a sustainable South Florida coastal ecosystem that is producing ecosystem services at the level society desires. Consensus was developed through facilitated meetings that aimed to conceptualize the ecosystem, develop ecosystem indicators, and conduct risk analysis. Resource managers, researchers, academics, and non-governmental organizations participated in these meetings and contributed to the synthesis of science and a myriad of science communications to transfer information to decision makers and the public.

abstract = {There is an increasing need to understand community-level or whole-ecosystem responses to multiple stressors since the impacts of multiple stressors on marine systems depend not only on species-level responses, but also on species interactions and ecosystem structure. In this study, we used a multi-model ecosystem simulation approach to explore the combined effects of fishing and primary productivity on different components of the food-web across a suite of ecosystems and a range of model types. Simulations were carried out under different levels of primary productivity and various fishing scenarios (targeting different trophic levels). Previous work exploring the effects of multiple stressors often assumed that the combined effects of stressors are additive, synergistic or antagonistic. In this study, we included a fourth category “dampened”, which refers to less negative or to less positive impacts on a given ecosystem component compared to additive effects, and in contrast to previous studies, we explicitly considered the direction of the combined effects (positive or negative). We focused on two specific combined effects (negative synergism and positive dampened) associated with the ecological risk of resultant lower fish biomass than expected under additive effects. Through a meta-analysis of the multi-models' simulation results, we found that (i) the risk of negative synergism was generally higher for low-trophic-level (LTL) taxa, implying that following an increase of fishing pressure on a given LTL stock, the subsequent decrease of biomass under low primary productivity would be higher than expected when fishing is the sole driver and (ii) the risk of positive dampened effects was generally higher for high-trophic-level (HTL) taxa, implying that given a management measure aimed at reducing the impact of fishing on HTL stocks, the subsequent rebuilding of these stocks would be slower than expected if only fishing were considered. Our approach to categorizing and exploring cumulative risk can be applied to evaluate other community properties and indicators and our findings could provide guidance in fisheries management.},

abstract = {Moving toward ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) necessitates a suite of ecological indicators that are responsive to fishing pressure, capable of tracking changes in the state of marine ecosystems, and related to management objectives. In this study, we employed the gradient forest method to assess the performance of 14 key ecological indicators in terms of specificity, sensitivity and the detection of thresholds for EBFM across ten marine ecosystems using four modelling frameworks (Ecopath with Ecosim, OSMOSE, Atlantis, and a multi-species size-spectrum model). Across seven of the ten ecosystems, high specificity to fishing pressure was found for most of the 14 indicators. The indicators biomass to fisheries catch ratio (B/C), mean lifespan and trophic level of fish community were found to have wide utility for evaluating fishing impacts. The biomass indicators, which have been identified as Essential Ocean Variables by the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), had lower performance for evaluating fishing impacts, yet they were most sensitive to changes in primary productivity. The indicator B/C was most sensitive to low levels of fishing pressure with a generally consistent threshold response around 0.4*FMSY (fishing mortality rate at maximum sustainable yield) across nine of the ten ecosystems. Over 50{\%} of the 14 indicators had threshold responses at, or below ∼0.6* FMSY for most ecosystems, indicating that these ecosystems would have already crossed a threshold for most indicators when fished at FMSY. This research provides useful insights on the performance of indicators, which contribute to facilitating the worldwide move toward EBFM.},

abstract = {Risk assessment methods are used worldwide to evaluate threats posed by fisheries and other impacts on living marine resources, and to prioritize management of these threats. We derive a simplified risk analysis for aggregate fish communities as a preliminary tool to identify priorities for further detailed assessment. Because some of the largest observed rates of sea surface temperature increase are on the northeast US continental shelf, we focused on climate change-driven risks to marine communities in this region. We evaluated climate vulnerability for six communities across two ecosystems: both commercial and non-commercial demersal fish, pelagic fish, and benthic invertebrates in the Gulf of Maine (GOM) and Mid-Atlantic bight (MAB). We first evaluated the probability that anticipated climate changes (e.g. warming water, decreased salinity, increased acidity, altered boundary currents) would occur in these regions, and rated the potential severity of change over the next 10 years. Then, we evaluated the sensitivity of each biological community in each region using 12 attributes (e.g. habitat and prey specificity, temperature and acidity sensitivity, larval dispersal, adult mobility, population productivity, etc.). Exposure to the key climate risks was related to community sensitivity in each region for an overall assessment of climate vulnerability. Climate risks from increased surface water temperature, sea level rise, and earlier spring were rated moderate to high in both regions, with additional moderate to high risks in the GOM from increased bottom temperature, stratification, and river inputs. Benthic invertebrates were rated most sensitive, with demersals intermediate and pelagics lowest. Two MAB communities were rated more sensitive than corresponding GOM communities, but greater short-term climate risks in the GOM indicated increased exposure for GOM communities. Overall, this simple analysis may help prioritize short-term regional climate risk management action, thus addressing key conditions related to fishery fluctuations beyond fishing itself.},

abstract = {Effective ecosystem-based management requires understanding ecosystem responses to multiple human threats, rather than focusing on single threats. To understand ecosystem responses to anthropogenic threats holistically, it is necessary to know how threats affect different components within ecosystems and ultimately alter ecosystem functioning. We used a case study of a Mediterranean seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) food web and expert knowledge elicitation in an application of the initial steps of a framework for assessment of cumulative human impacts on food webs. We produced a conceptual seagrass food web model, determined the main trophic relationships, identified the main threats to the food web components, and assessed the components' vulnerability to those threats. Some threats had high (e.g., coastal infrastructure) or low impacts (e.g., agricultural runoff) on all food web components, whereas others (e.g., introduced carnivores) had very different impacts on each component. Partitioning the ecosystem into its components enabled us to identify threats previously overlooked and to reevaluate the importance of threats commonly perceived as major. By incorporating this understanding of system vulnerability with data on changes in the state of each threat (e.g., decreasing domestic pollution and increasing fishing) into a food web model, managers may be better able to estimate and predict cumulative human impacts on ecosystems and to prioritize conservation actions.},

abstract = {With rapidly increasing rates of contemporary extinction, predicting extinction vulnerability and identifying how multiple stressors drive non-random species loss have become key challenges in ecology. These assessments are crucial for avoiding the loss of key functional groups that sustain ecosystem processes and services. We developed a novel predictive framework of species extinction vulnerability and applied it to coral reef fishes. Although relatively few coral reef fishes are at risk of global extinction from climate disturbances, a negative convex relationship between fish species locally vulnerable to climate change vs. fisheries exploitation indicates that the entire community is vulnerable on the many reefs where both stressors co-occur. Fishes involved in maintaining key ecosystem functions are more at risk from fishing than climate disturbances. This finding is encouraging as local and regional commitment to fisheries management action can maintain reef ecosystem functions pending progress towards the more complex global problem of stabilizing the climate. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Risk assessments quantify the probability of undesirable events along with their consequences. They are used to prioritize management interventions and assess tradeoffs, serving as an essential component of ecosystem‐based management (). A central objective of most risk assessments for conservation and management is to characterize uncertainty and impacts associated with one or more pressures of interest. Risk assessments have been used in marine resource management to help evaluate the risk of environmental, ecological, and anthropogenic pressures on species or habitats including for data‐poor fisheries management (e.g., toxicity, probability of extinction, habitat alteration impacts). Traditionally, marine risk assessments focused on singular pressure‐response relationships, but recent advancements have included use of risk assessments in an context, providing a method for evaluating the cumulative impacts of multiple pressures on multiple ecosystem components. Here, we describe a conceptual framework for ecosystem risk assessment (), highlighting its role in operationalizing, with specific attention to ocean management considerations. This framework builds on the ecotoxicological and conservation literature on risk assessment and includes recent advances that focus on risks posed by fishing to marine ecosystems. We review how examples of s from the United States fit into this framework, explore the variety of analytical approaches that have been used to conduct s, and assess the challenges and data gaps that remain. This review discusses future prospects for s as decision‐support tools, their expanded role in integrated ecosystem assessments, and the development of next‐generation risk assessments for coupled natural–human systems.},

abstract = {The marine environment is heavily exploited, but unintentional consequences cause wide-ranging negative effects to its characteristics. Linkage frameworks (e.g., DPSIR [driver-pressure-state-impact-response]) are commonly used to describe an interaction between human activities and ecological characteristics of the ecosystem, but as each linkage is viewed independently, the diversity of pressures that affect those characteristics may not be identified or managed effectively. Here we demonstrate an approach for using linkages to build a simple network to capture the complex relationships arising from multiple sectors and their activities. Using data-analysis tools common to ecology, we show how linkages can be placed into mechanistically similar groups. Management measures can be combined into fewer and more simplified measures that target groups of pressures rather than individual pressures, which is likely to increase compliance and the success of the measure while reducing the cost of enforcement. Given that conservation objectives (regional priorities) can vary, we also demonstrate by way of a case study example from the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, how management priorities might change, and illustrate how the approach can be used to identify sectors for control that best support the conservation objectives. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Modeled temperature explained nearly as much variability in reproductive success of sprat (Sprattus sprattus; Clupeidae) as measured temperatures during 1973-2005, and both the spawner biomass and the temperature have influenced recruitment for at least 50 years. The three Baltic Sea models estimate relatively similar developments (increases) in biomass and fishery yield during twenty-first century climate change (ca. 28 {\%} range among models). However, this uncertainty is exceeded by the one associated with the fish population model, and by the source of global climate data used by regional models.

For this purpose 16 transient simulations for 1961-2099 using a coupled physical-biogeochemical model of the Baltic Sea were performed. Four climate scenarios were combined with four nutrient load scenarios ranging from a pessimistic business-as-usual to a more optimistic case following the Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP). Annual and seasonal mean changes of climate parameters and ecological quality indicators describing the environmental status of the Baltic Sea like bottom oxygen, nutrient and phytoplankton concentrations and Secchi depths were studied. Assuming present-day nutrient concentrations in the rivers, nutrient loads from land increase during the twenty first century in all investigated scenario simulations due to increased volume flows caused by increased net precipitation in the Baltic catchment area. In addition, remineralization rates increase due to increased water temperatures causing enhanced nutrient flows from the sediments. Cause-and-effect studies suggest that both processes may play an important role for the biogeochemistry of eutrophicated seas in future climate partly counteracting nutrient load reduction efforts like the BSAP. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

Differences between areas, i.e. Bornholm Basin, Gdansk Deep and Gotland Basin, as well as between 5 year periods, were investigated by means of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). No significant differences in mesozooplankton biomass between areas were found. On the other hand, clear time-trends could be demonstrated and related to salinity and temperature, with P.elongatus biomass mainly dependent on salinity and T. longicornis, Acartia spp. and cladocerans biomasses dependent, to a large extent, on thermal conditions. Decreasing salinities since the early 1980s due to a lack of major inflows of highly saline water from the North Sea and increased river run-off, both triggered by meteorological conditions, obviously caused a decrease in biomass of P.elongatus. Contrarily, the standing stocks of the other abundant copepod species and cladocerans followed, to a large degree, the temperature development and showed, in general, an increase. The shift in species composition during this period is considered to be a reason for decreasing growth rates of Baltic herring (Clupea harengus) since the early 1980s, and for sprat (Sprattus sprattus) since the early 1990s. Generally, it is suggested that low mesozooplankton biomasses in the 1990s were caused, at least partially, by amplified predation by clupeid fish stocks.},

These changes in temperature and salinity resulted in a change in the dominance of the mesozooplankton community from Pseudocalanus sp. to Temora longicornis and Acartia spp. Similar to the copepod community, the central Baltic fish community shifted from cod (Gadus morhua), dominant during the 1980s, to sprat (Sprattus sprattus), dominant during the 1990s. Further, the commercially important pelagic fish species herring (Clupea harengus) and sprat exhibited reductions in growth. Using Principal Component and Correlation Analyses we investigated the temporal variability in the importance of the food supply as well as competition on condition of central Baltic pelagic fish species. Our results indicate that herring condition results from a combined effect of changes in the food environment and increased competition with sprat, while sprat condition appeared to be primarily determined by intra-specific competition.},

Little attention has been given, however, to the role of habitat heterogeneity in modulating the response of animal communities to external climate forcing. Here we investigate the long-term dynamics of Acartia spp., Temora longicornis, and Pseudocalanus acuspes, three dominant zooplankton species inhabiting different pelagic habitats in the Central Baltic Sea (CBS). We use the three copepods as indicator species for changes in the CBS zooplankton community and apply non-linear statistical modeling techniques to compare spatial population trends and to identify their drivers. We demonstrate that effects of climate variability and change depend strongly on species-specific habitat utilization, being more direct and pronounced at the upper water layer. We propose that the differential functional response to climate-related drivers in relation to strong habitat segregation is due to alterations of the species' environmental niches. We stress the importance of understanding how anticipated climate change will affect ecological niches and habitats in order to project spatio-temporal changes in species abundance and distribution. {\textcopyright} 2014 Otto et al.},

abstract = {Trophodynamics and life-cycle strategies of the copepods Temora longicornis and Acartia longiremis in the Baltic Sea were studied, focussing on the seasonal progression of (i) fatty acid (FA) markers in seston and females, (ii) the copepods' condition as well as (iii) their stage compositions. Trophic marker diversity and high levels of 18:1(n-9) in copepods and seston indicated omnivory for both species. Significant inter-specific and seasonal differences in markers reflected different trophic niches of both species and a seasonal succession in diet composition. Storage lipids of A. longiremis were characterized by polyunsaturated C18-FAs, and those of T. longicornis by 16:1(n-7), 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3). Diatoms were important for T. longicornis at times of peak egg production or lipid accumulation. The preference for heterotrophic prey over diatoms of A. longiremis probably reflects a prevailing ambush-feeding strategy. Triacylglycerol reserves in T. longicornis increased in autumn and probably served as a buffer against starvation during winter. Reproductive activities were low during winter and copepodite stages developed slowly. All A. longiremis copepodids were present during winter, but no lipid accumulation was observed for overwintering. Such constantly low lipid levels suggest insufficient food supply, the absence of triggers for the induction of wax ester anabolism or a population-specific life-history trait, which does not rely on winter energy reserves, but active foraging in the winter season. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author.},

abstract = {The Baltic Sea is a shallow, semi-enclosed brackish sea suffering like many other coastal seas from eutrophication caused by human impact. Hence, nutrient load abatement strategies are intensively discussed. With the help of a high-resolution, coupled physical-biogeochemical circulation model we investigate the combined impact of changing nutrient loads from land and changing climate during the 21st century as projected from a global climate model regionalized to the Baltic Sea region. Novel compared to previous studies are an extraordinary spin-up based upon historical reconstructions of atmospheric, nutrient load and runoff forcing, revised nutrient load scenarios and a comparison of nutrient load scenario simulations with and without changing climate. We found in almost all scenario simulations, with differing nutrient inputs, reduced eutrophication and improved ecological state compared to the reference period 1976–2005. This result is a long-lasting consequence of ongoing nutrient load reductions since the 1980s. Only in case of combined high-end nutrient load and climate scenarios, eutrophication is reinforced. Differences compared to earlier studies are explained by the experimental setup including nutrient loads during the historical period and by the projected nutrient loads. We found that the impact of warming climate may amplify the effects of eutrophication and primary production. However, effects of changing climate, within the range of considered greenhouse gas emission scenarios, are smaller than effects of considered nutrient load changes, in particular under low nutrient conditions. Hence, nutrient load reductions following the Baltic Sea Action Plan will lead to improved environmental conditions independently of future climate change.},

abstract = {An indoor mesocosm system was set up to study the response of phytoplankton and zooplankton spring succession to winter and spring warming of sea surface temperatures. The experimental temperature regimes consisted of the decadal average of the Kiel Bight, Baltic Sea, and three elevated regimes with 2°C, 4°C, and 6°C temperature difference from that at baseline. While the peak of the phytoplankton spring bloom was accelerated only weakly by increasing temperatures (1.4 days per degree Celsius), the subsequent biomass minimum of phytoplankton was accelerated more strongly (4.25 days per degree Celsius). Phytoplankton size structure showed a pronounced response to warming, with large phytoplankton being more dominant in the cooler mesocosms. The first seasonal ciliate peak was accelerated by 2.1 days per degree Celsius and the second one by 2.0 days per degree Celsius. The over-wintering copepod populations declined faster in the warmer mesocosm, and the appearance of nauplii was strongly accelerated by temperature (9.2 days per degree Celsius). The strong difference between the acceleration of the phytoplankton peak and the acceleration of the nauplii could be one of the "Achilles heels" of pelagic systems subject to climate change, because nauplii are the most starvation-sensitive life cycle stage of copepods and the most important food item of first-feeding fish larvae. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Interannual variations in spawning time, defined as the peak in egg abundance, of cod (Gadus morhua) in the Bornholm Basin, Baltic Sea, were analysed. Effects of water temperature, size and age structure of the spawning stock, abundance of food, and timing of spawning in preceding years were studied as possible determinants of annual spawning time. During the 1970s and late 1980s, peak spawning took place between the end of April and mid-June. A remarkable shift in the timing of spawning to the end of July was observed in the 1990s. The key factors governing the timing of spawning are water temperature during the period of gonadal maturation, density-dependent processes related to the size of the spawning stock, and food availability. The age structure of the spawning stock is suggested to have an additional effect. A high proportion of first-time spawners and decreasing water temperature have caused progressively delayed spawning since the early 1990s. Late spawning involves several processes that are detrimental to the survival of the early life stages. Recruitment in the mid-1990s was below what could be expected from spawning stock biomass and favourable hydrographic conditions. It is therefore suggested that the rebuilding of the Baltic cod stock could be improved by reduced fishing pressure in spring on early spawners.

abstract = {Marine ecosystems are undergoing substantial changes due to human-induced pressures. Analysis of long-term data series is a valuable tool for understanding naturally and anthropogenically induced changes in plankton communities. In the present study, seasonal monitoring data were collected in three sub-basins of the northern Baltic Sea between 1979 and 2011 and statistically analysed for trends and interactions between surface water hydrography, inorganic nutrient concentrations and phyto- and zooplankton community composition. The most conspicuous hydrographic change was a significant increase in late summer surface water temperatures over the study period. In addition, salinity decreased and dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations increased in some basins. Based on redundancy analysis (RDA), warming was the key environmental factor explaining the observed changes in plankton communities: the general increase in total phytoplankton biomass, Cyanophyceae, Prymnesiophyceae and Chrysophyceae, and decrease in Cryptophyceae throughout the study area, as well as increase in rotifers and decrease in total zooplankton, cladoceran and copepod abundances in some basins. We conclude that the plankton communities in the Baltic Sea have shifted towards a food web structure with smaller sized organisms, leading to decreased energy available for grazing zooplankton and planktivorous fish. The shift is most probably due to complex interactions between warming, eutrophication and increased top-down pressure due to overexploitation of resources, and the resulting trophic cascades. {\textcopyright} 2013 Suikkanen et al.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic global warming has significantly influenced physical and biological processes at global and regional scales. The observed and anticipated changes in global climate present significant opportunities and challenges for societies and economies. We compare the vulnerability of 132 national economies to potential climate change impacts on their capture fisheries using an indicator-based approach. Countries in Central and Western Africa (e.g. Malawi, Guinea, Senegal, and Uganda), Peru and Colombia in north-western South America, and four tropical Asian countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Pakistan, and Yemen) were identified as most vulnerable. This vulnerability was due to the combined effect of predicted warming, the relative importance of fisheries to national economies and diets, and limited societal capacity to adapt to potential impacts and opportunities. Many vulnerable countries were also among the world's least developed countries whose inhabitants are among the world's poorest and twice as reliant on fish, which provides 27{\%} of dietary protein compared to 13{\%} in less vulnerable countries. These countries also produce 20{\%} of the world's fish exports and are in greatest need of adaptation planning to maintain or enhance the contribution that fisheries can make to poverty reduction. Although the precise impacts and direction of climate-driven change for particular fish stocks and fisheries are uncertain, our analysis suggests they are likely to lead to either increased economic hardship or missed opportunities for development in countries that depend upon fisheries but lack the capacity to adapt. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {This chapter assesses how countries are managing current and projected disaster risks, given knowledge of how risks are changing with observations and projections of weather and climate extremes [Table 3–2, 3.3], vulnerability and exposure [4.3], and impacts [4.4]. It focuses on the design of national systems for managing such risks, the roles played by actors involved in the system, and the functions they perform, acknowledging that complementary actions to manage risks are also taken at local and international level as described in Chapters 5 and 7. National systems are at the core of countries' capacity to meet the challenges of observed and projected trends in exposure, vulnerability, and weather and climate extremes (high agreement, robust evidence). Effective national systems comprise multiple actors from national and sub-national governments, private sector, research bodies, and civil society, including community-based organizations, playing differential but complementary roles to manage risk according to their accepted functions and capacities. These actors work in partnership across temporal, spatial, administrative, and social scales, supported by relevant scientific and traditional knowledge. Specific characteristics of national systems vary between countries and across scales depending on their socio-cultural, political, and administrative environments and development status. [6.2] The national level plays a key role in governing and managing disaster risks because national government is central to providing risk management-related public goods as it commonly maintains financial and organizational authority in planning and implementing these goods (high agreement, robust evidence). National governments are charged with the provision of public goods such as ensuring the economic and social well-being, safety, and security of their citizens from disasters, including the protection of the poorest and most vulnerable citizens. They also control budgetary allocations as well as creating legislative frameworks to guide actions by other actors.},

The framework encompasses eight steps, and provides guidance on pitfalls to be avoided at each step.

Step 3 assigns weights to nine screening criteria for the candidate indicators: concreteness, theoretical basis, public awareness, cost, measurement, historic data, sensitivity, responsiveness, and specificity. Step 4 scores the indicators against the criteria, and Step 5 summarizes the results. Steps 3–5 offer technical aspects on which guidance is provided, including scoring standards for criteria and a generalized method for applying the standards when scoring individual indicators. Multi-criterion summarization methods are recommended for most applications. Steps 6 and 7 are concerned with deciding how many indicators are needed, and making the final selection of complementary suites of indicators. Ordinarily, these steps are done interactively with the users of the indicators, thus providing guidance on process rather than technical approach. Step 8 is the clear presentation to all users of the information contained. The discussion also includes the special case in which indicators are used in formal decision rules.},

abstract = {One of the longest marine monitoring programs in the North Sea has been the spatiotemporal surveying of subsurface plankton since 1931. During this period a regime shift was detected in the late 1980s culminating in marked changes in phytoplankton, zooplankton and in the fisheries of horse mackerel. Here we used the phytoplankton colour index, a visual biomass estimate, from 1948 to 2010 and total diatom abundance from 1958 to 2010 to test whether the well-documented regime shift could have been anticipated by the recently developed Early-Warning Signals for critical transitions (EWS). We estimated EWS, namely autocorrelation and standard deviation, within moving windows along the time series prior to the regime shift. We found that both statistics increased revealing that the North Sea ecosystem was becoming progressively unstable prior to the regime shift. Moreover, this high-resolution time series permitted us to test for robustness, error and significance of the EWS. We did that by dividing the time series into independent blocks and estimating EWS after bootstrapping and randomising the blocks. This alternative approach confirmed the robustness of the EWS with limited associated errors. In particular, we found that the warning was significantly evident years before the onset of the regime shift. We conclude that EWS may provide robust and timely warning for upcoming regime shifts depending on the quality and quantity of recorded data in marine ecosystems.},

Although resilience has been a highly influential concept, its interpretation has remained largely qualitative. Here we describe an emerging family of methods for quantifying resilience on the basis of observations. A first set of methods is based on the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which implies that recovery upon small perturbations becomes slower as a system approaches a tipping point. Such slowing down can be measured experimentally but may also be indirectly inferred from changes in natural fluctuations and spatial patterns. A second group of methods aims to characterize the resilience of alternative states in probabilistic terms based on large numbers of observations as in long time series or satellite images. These generic approaches to measuring resilience complement the system-specific knowledge needed to infer the effects of environmental change on the resilience of complex systems.},

abstract = {Marine fisheries support the livelihoods of millions of people worldwide. These fisheries and the communities that depend on them are highly vulnerable to climate change and other interacting anthropogenic threats. The cumulative and interacting effects of these stressors could potentially produce declines in fish production, which would significantly impact artisanal fishers. Assessing relative vulnerability of fishing communities to anthropogenic stressors is an important first step to identifying mitigation or adaptation strategies. This study assessed the vulnerability of 12 coastal communities in the Northern Gulf of California to disruptions in fishing activities from anthropogenic stressors, including climate change. The Northern Gulf is a megadiverse area and a major source of fishery resources. Quantitative indicator indices based on secondary and primary data were developed to assess the three aspects of vulnerability: sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity. The key components of vulnerability varied amongst communities. Vulnerability was higher in communities with higher fishing dependence and lower socioeconomic diversification. The approach presented here provides important insights into the type of policy actions that might be needed in different communities for adaptation and mitigation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Everyday we face all kinds of risks, and insurance is in the business of providing us a means to transfer or share these risks, usually to eliminate or reduce the resulting financial burden, in exchange for a predetermined price or tariff. Actuaries are considered professional experts in the economic assessment of uncertain events, and equipped with many statistical tools for analytics, they help formulate a fair and reasonable tariff associated with these risks. An important part of the process of establishing fair insurance tariffs is risk classification, which involves the grouping of risks into various classes that share a homogeneous set of characteristics allowing the actuary to reasonably price discriminate. This article is a survey paper on the statistical tools for risk classification used in insurance. Because of recent availability of more complex data in the industry together with the technology to analyze these data, we additionally discuss modern techniques that have recently emerged in the statistics discipline and can be used for risk classification. While several of the illustrations discussed in the paper focus on general, or non-life, insurance, several of the principles we examine can be similarly applied to life insurance. Furthermore, we also distinguish between a priori and a posteriori ratemaking. The former is a process which forms the basis for ratemaking when a policyholder is new and insufficient information may be available. The latter process uses additional historical information about policyholder claims when this becomes available. In effect, the resulting a posteriori premium allows one to correct and adjust the previous a priori premium making the price discrimination even more fair and reasonable. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract = {In this paper, a methodology for construction projects risk assessment under epistemic uncertainty (i.e., uncertainty arising from lack of data/knowledge) has been proposed. In practice, as the sufficient data from historical sources for probabilistic analysis are quite difficult to obtain, qualitative risk assessment methodologies based on expert's judgments are commonly used in construction industry. However, these insufficient probabilistic data combined with experts' judgments can be used in the risks evaluation process to reduce uncertainties and biasness. All the methodologies developed so far have assumed that the degrees of uncertainties (i.e., levels of uncertainties) involved in individual risk event are equal. However, in practice, the degree of uncertainties that involved in each risk event may vary due to the variation in the availability or quality of data obtained from multiple sources (e.g., from experts' opinions and past data from similar projects). Therefore, evaluation of risks considering the degree of uncertainty involved in individual risk events may assist project manager in setting-up response strategies to mitigate threat to the project objectives. This paper proposes a risk assessment methodology using triangular fuzzy numbering system to compute risk value by combining expert's opinion and insufficient historical data. A modified form of general ramp-type fuzzy membership function for quantification of uncertainty range of each risk event and an extended VIKOR method for risk ranking with these uncertainty ranges have been used. The most notable difference with other fuzzy risk assessment methods is the use of algorithm to handle the uncertainties involved in individual risk event. The proposed risk assessment methodology is illustrated for two practical example problems: (1) a steel-frame structured building and (2) a rehabilitation project of a building.},

abstract = {We propose a new approach to assess systemic financial stability of a banking system using standard tools from modern risk management in combination with a network model of interbank loans. We apply our model to a unique data set of all Austrian banks. We find that correlation in banks' asset portfolios dominates contagion as the main source of systemic risk. Contagion is rare but can nonetheless wipe out a major part of the banking system. Low bankruptcy costs and an efficient crisis resolution policy are crucial to limit the systemwide impact of contagious default events. We compute the quotvalue at riskquotfor a lender of last resort and find that the funds necessary to prevent contagion are surprisingly small.{\textcopyright} 2006 INFORMS.},

In this paper, we present an approach to assess the risk to ecosystem components from human activities common to marine and coastal ecosystems. We build on: (i) a linkage framework that describes how human activities can impact the ecosystem through pressures, and (ii) a qualitative expert judgement assessment of impact chains describing the exposure and sensitivity of ecological components to those activities. Using case study examples applied at European regional sea scale, we evaluate the risk of an adverse ecological impact from current human activities to a suite of ecological components and, once impacted, the time required for recovery to pre-impact conditions should those activities subside. Grouping impact chains by sectors, pressure type, or ecological components enabled impact risks and recovery times to be identified, supporting resource managers in their efforts to prioritize threats for management, identify most at-risk components, and generate time frames for ecosystem recovery.},

abstract = {Management of fisheries around the world is challenged by fishing impacts on habitats, bycatch species, threatened and endangered species, and even associated ecological communities. One response to these other factors has been a call for ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), which demands consideration of the above non-target interactions. A challenge with implementation of EBFM is the scale and range of issues to be considered, all of which cannot be addressed at the same level of detail as for target species, due to data or time constraints. We developed an approach to progress the EBFM mandate in Australia, using a new ecological risk assessment framework applied to fisheries, termed Ecological Risk Assessment for the Effects of Fishing (ERAEF). Novel features of this framework include its hierarchical structure and its precautionary approach to uncertainty. The amount of information required increases through the hierarchy, and allows application in data-limited situations. The ERAEF framework has been applied to over 30 fisheries in Australia and elsewhere. The efficiencies in application of the hierarchical approach are illustrated by the south-east otter trawl fishery, where following Level 1 assessment of all components, an initial set of 600 species and 158 habitats was reduced to a group of concern of 159 species and 46 habitats using the Level 2 analysis, with the number of species of concern further reduced to 25 following Level 3 analysis. As a result of the assessments in Australia, management actions have been enacted for a range of the high risk species. Overall, the ERAEF approach offers a realistic method to assess ecological risk in an EBFM context, and has applicability in a wide range of fisheries. The interactive and inclusive nature of the approach also has the advantage of bringing stakeholders, scientists and managers together to develop management solutions. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

@article{Hare2016,
abstract = {Climate change and decadal variability are impacting marine fish and invertebrate species worldwide and these impacts will continue for the foreseeable future. Quantitative approaches have been developed to examine climate impacts on productivity, abundance, and distribution of various marine fish and invertebrate species. However, it is difficult to apply these approaches to large numbers of species owing to the lack of mechanistic understanding sufficient for quantitative analyses, as well as the lack of scientific infrastructure to support these more detailed studies. Vulnerability assessments provide a framework for evaluating climate impacts over a broad range of species with existing information. These methods combine the exposure of a species to a stressor (climate change and decadal variability) and the sensitivity of species to the stressor. These two components are then combined to estimate an overall vulnerability. Quantitative data are used when available, but qualitative information and expert opinion are used when quantitative data is lacking. Here we conduct a climate vulnerability assessment on 82 fish and invertebrate species in the Northeast U.S. Shelf including exploited, forage, and protected species. We define climate vulnerability as the extent to which abundance or productivity of a species in the region could be impacted by climate change and decadal variability. We find that the overall climate vulnerability is high to very high for approximately half the species assessed; diadromous and benthic invertebrate species exhibit the greatest vulnerability. In addition, the majority of species included in the assessment have a high potential for a change in distribution in response to projected changes in climate. Negative effects of climate change are expected for approximately half of the species assessed, but some species are expected to be positively affected (e.g., increase in productivity or move into the region). These results will inform research and management activities related to understanding and adapting marine fisheries management and conservation to climate change and decadal variability.},

abstract = {A 38-year record of bottom-water dissolved oxygen concentrations in coastal marine ecosystems around Denmark (1965-2003) and a longer, partially reconstructed record of total nitrogen (TN) inputs (1900-2003) were assembled with the purpose of describing long-term patterns in hypoxia and anoxia. In addition, interannual variations in bottom-water oxygen concentrations were analyzed in relation to various explanatory variables (bottom temperature, wind speed, advective transport, TN loading). Reconstructed TN loads peaked in the 1980s, with a gradual decline to the present, commensurate with a legislated nutrient reduction strategy. Mean bottom-water oxygen concentrations during summer have significantly declined in coastal marine ecosystems, decreasing substantially during the 1980s and were extremely variable thereafter. Despite decreasing TN loads, the worst hypoxic event ever recorded in open waters occurred in 2002. For estuaries and coastal areas, bottom-water oxygen concentrations were best described by TN input from land and wind speed in July-September, explaining 52{\%} of the interannual variation in concentrations. For open sea areas, bottom-water oxygen concentrations were also modulated by TN input from land; however, additional significant variables included advective transport of water and Skagerrak surface-water temperature and explained 49{\%} of interannual variations in concentrations. Reductions in the number of benthic species and alpha diversity were significantly related to the duration of the 2002 hypoxic event. Gradual decreases in diversity measures (number of species and alpha diversity) over the first 2-4 weeks show that the benthic community undergoes significant changes before the duration of hypoxia is severe enough to cause the community to collapse. Enhanced sediment-water fluxes of NH 4+ and PO43- occur with hypoxia, increasing nutrient concentrations in the water column and stimulating additional phytoplankton production. Repeated hypoxic events have changed the character of benthic communities and how organic matter is processed in sediments. Our data suggest that repeated hypoxic events lead to an increase in susceptibility of Danish waters to eutrophication and further hypoxia. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {How multiple stressors influence fish stock dynamics is a crucial question in ecology in general and in fisheries science in particular. Using time-series covering a 30 yr period, we show that the body growth of the central Baltic Sea herring Clupea harengus, both in terms of condition and weight-at-age (WAA), has shifted from being mainly driven by hydro-climatic forces to an interspecific density-dependent control. The shift in the mechanisms of regulation of herring growth is triggered by the abundance of sprat, the main food competitor for herring. Abundances of sprat above the threshold of ̃18 × 10 10 ind. decouple herring growth from hydro-climatic factors (i.e. salinity), and become the main driver of herring growth variations. At high sprat densities, herring growth is considerably lower than at low sprat levels, regardless of the salinity conditions, indicative of hysteresis in the response of herring growth to salinity changes. The threshold dynamic accurately explains the changes in herring growth during the past 3 decades and in turn contributes to elucidate the parallel drastic drop in herring spawning stock biomass. Studying the interplay between different stressors can provide fundamental information for the management of exploited resources. The management of the central Baltic herring stock should be adaptive and take into consideration the dual response of herring growth to hydro-climatic forces and food-web structure for a sound ecosystem approach to fisheries. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2010.},

Alternation of the periods of increase and decrease in salinity of the Baltic Sea against the background of climate changes (temperature increase) and eutrophication affect the state of the entire Baltic ecosystem, including zooplankton. For these periods, the dynamics of zooplankton in the Baltic Sea were analyzed based on literature data and results of regular research in the southeastern Baltic Sea during 1998-2007. The changes in the hydrological situation were accompanied by significant changes in the zooplankton community. In the 1990s-2000s, the abundance and biomass of brackish-water and thermophilous species primarily of Cladocera and Copepoda increased markedly. The role of the previously dominant marine copepod Pseudocalanus elongatus decreased due to salinity reduction in the deep-water part of the Baltic Sea. Maximum development of zooplankton occurred in years of the greatest warming-up of the water (2001, 2005-2007) against the background of a general positive trend of zooplankton abundance in the last decade. {\textcopyright} Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2009.},

abstract = {Hypoxia, a growing worldwide problem, has been intermittently present in the modern Baltic Sea since its formation ca. 8000 cal. yr BP. However, both the spatial extent and intensity of hypoxia have increased with anthropogenic eutrophication due to nutrient inputs. Physical processes, which control stratification and the renewal of oxygen in bottom waters, are important constraints on the formation and maintenance of hypoxia. Climate controlled inflows of saline water from the North Sea through the Danish Straits is a critical controlling factor governing the spatial extent and duration of hypoxia. Hypoxia regulates the biogeochemical cycles of both phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) in the water column and sediments. Significant amounts of P are currently released from sediments, an order of magnitude larger than anthropogenic inputs. The Baltic Sea is unique for coastal marine ecosystems experiencing N losses in hypoxic waters below the halocline. Although benthic communities in the Baltic Sea are naturally constrained by salinity gradients, hypoxia has resulted in habitat loss over vast areas and the elimination of benthic fauna, and has severely disrupted benthic food webs. Nutrient load reductions are needed to reduce the extent, severity, and effects of hypoxia. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

@article{Bradtke2010,
abstract = {On the basis of monthly averaged satellite data, this study examined how the annual cycle of the Baltic Sea surface temperature (SST) varied spatially and temporally during the period 1986-2005. We conclude that there are two main thermal seasons in the Baltic Sea separated only by short transitional periods - spring lasting about one month, and autumn lasting two months. Generally speaking, summer covers the part of the year from June to October with the highest monthly mean SST in August. Winter, with a minimum monthly mean SST in February in shallow waters or in March in deeper areas, lasts from December to April. As a result of climate changes over the Baltic Sea region, strong positive trends in SST occur in the summer months. In consequence, the period with extremely high sea surface water temperatures has become slightly longer in the central Baltic. In the last decade winter changes in SST display zero or even negative tendencies. The investigated period was characterized by an annual increase in mean temperatures of about 0.03-0.07°C. However, the rates of monthly mean SST changes were sometimes more than three times as high. {\textcopyright} 2010, by Institute of Oceanology PAS.},

@article{Aria2017,
abstract = {The use of bibliometrics is gradually extending to all disciplines. It is particularly suitable for science mapping at a time when the emphasis on empirical contributions is producing voluminous, fragmented, and controversial research streams. Science mapping is complex and unwieldly because it is multi-step and frequently requires numerous and diverse software tools, which are not all necessarily freeware. Although automated workflows that integrate these software tools into an organized data flow are emerging, in this paper we propose a unique open-source tool, designed by the authors, called bibliometrix, for performing comprehensive science mapping analysis. bibliometrix supports a recommended workflow to perform bibliometric analyses. As it is programmed in R, the proposed tool is flexible and can be rapidly upgraded and integrated with other statistical R-packages. It is therefore useful in a constantly changing science such as bibliometrics.},
